DIRECTORS’ REPORT (CONTINUED)
56      YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD
At the start of each year, KPIs and KRAs are reviewed and selected by Board as being the most appropriate to the business. Assessment
against these measures is determined following the end of each year.
Performance against the STI Scorecard and the Individual KRAs are converted to two payout multipliers, and applied to the Target
STI opportunity to determine the actual STI award. Accordingly, the Executive’s STI award is heavily influenced by the achievement of
Company KPIs.
Further detail on the STI Scorecard – 2017
The STI Scorecard measures the Company’s performance in respect of Profitability, Health, Safety and Environment and Specific Business
Unit measures.
2017 STI outcome
STI outcomes are calculated by multiplying the target STI opportunity by the STI Scorecard payout multiplier and the individual performance
payout multiplier.
Any STI award is delivered as a cash payment around April each year.
