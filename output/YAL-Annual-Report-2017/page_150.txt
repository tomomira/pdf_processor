Key Audit Matter
How the matter was addressed during the audit
Acquisition of Coal & Allied Industries Limited
(“Coal & Allied”)
(Note E1)
The Group acquired 100% of the issued capital of Coal
& Allied on 1 September 2017 for total consideration of
$3.55 billion. The net assets acquired were valued at
$3.72 billion, leading to a gain on acquisition of $176
million being recognised.
The Group is required to recognise Coal & Allied’s
assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the
acquisition-date fair values; and the excess or deficit of
consideration less those fair values as goodwill or gain
on acquisition. Yancoal management engaged third-
party experts to provide valuation, tax and business
modelling support to determine the fair values of Coal &
Allied’s assets and liabilities under AASB 3 Business
Combinations.
There is a high level of judgement involved in
calculating the fair value of assets and liabilities
acquired; particularly the valuation of mining tenements
and associated tax balances. Given the extent of
judgement required we consider this a significant risk of
material misstatement.
Our audit procedures included, among others:
• Assessing the source and appropriateness of key
assumptions made in the purchase price allocation,
including coal prices, life of mine plans,
operating/capital costs, discount rates, inflation rates
and foreign exchange rates. We compared these
assumptions with external benchmarks and reports
prepared by appropriate experts;
• In assessing key assumptions, we utilised our
valuation experts who assisted with assessing the
valuation methodology against accepted industry
practice, discount rates, cross checks of the valuation,
coal prices and forecast foreign exchange rates;
• Comparing the accounting valuation and taxation
valuation to check the deferred taxation calculations to
consider whether deferred taxation balances were
recognised appropriately;
• Agreeing the consideration paid to supporting
documentation, agreeing the accounting entries and
recalculating the gain on acquisition; and
• Assessing the Group’s acquisition accounting
disclosures.
Impairment of non-current assets and associated
Moolarben impairment reversal
(Note C3)
A substantial amount of the Group’s non-current assets
(over 80%) relate to tangible and intangible assets
which are subject to an impairment assessment in
accordance with AASB 136 Impairment of Assets or
AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and
Measurement.
These assets include property plant and equipment
(note C1), mining tenements (note C2), intangible
assets (note C5), interest bearing loan to associate
(note D1) and royalty receivable (note C9), receivables
from joint venture and other receivables from WICET
(note C7).
In performing the impairment assessment, the
impairment provision associated with Moolarben was
reversed as the mine’s financial metrics and operations
have improved significantly and the net realisable value
of the Moolarben asset is above the book value of the
mine with substantial headroom an impairment reversal
of $100 million before income tax was recognised.
Management’s impairment assessment of these non-
current assets are considered a key audit matter as they
are often highly judgmental and based on many
assumptions, specifically coal prices, operating/capital
costs, discount rates, inflation rates and foreign
exchange rates, which are affected by expected future
Our audit procedures included, among others:
• Assessing management’s determination of the
Group’s Cash-Generating Units;
• Engaging our valuation team who assisted with the
review of the asset valuation model;
• Agreeing the assumptions used in the asset valuation
model such as discount rate, resource prices,
exchange rates, production and sales volumes, coal
resources and reserves, operating and other costs;
and agreeing the appropriateness of the valuation
methodology used;
• Testing the mathematical accuracy of discounted cash
flow models and agreeing relevant data to supporting
information;
• Performing sensitivity analyses on key inputs; and
• Assessing the Group’s impairment of assets
disclosures.
