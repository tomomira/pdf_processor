FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      ANNUAL REPORT 2017      87
(x) Going concern
For the year ended 31 December 2017, the Group had a profit after
income tax of $229 million (31 December 2016: loss after income tax
of $227 million) from continuing operations and a net cash flow from
operating activities of $408 million (31 December 16: cash outflow of
$24 million). In addition refer to Note F1(c) regarding the commitment
to purchase 28.898% of Warkworth Joint Venture from Mitsubish
Development Pty Ltd (“MDP”) and Note D7(iv) regarding the potential
requirement to purchase 32.4% of HVO from MDP.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern
basis, which contemplates the continuation of normal business
operations and the realisation of assets and settlement of liabilities
in the normal course of business. On the basis of these factors,
the Directors believe that the going concern basis of preparation
is appropriate and the Group will be able to repay its debts as and
when they fall due. In the event that the Group cannot continue as
a going concern, it may not realise its assets and settle its liabilities
in the normal course of operations and at the amounts stated in the
financial statements.
The Directors also note the following with regards to the ability of the
Group to continue as a going concern:
(i)	 At 31 December 2017, the Group has a cash balance of
$207 million.
(ii)	 At 31 December 2017, the Group has surplus net current assets of
$676 million.
(iii)	The Directors of Yanzhou Coal Mining Company Limited
(“Yanzhou”) have provided financial support in the form of a
A$1.4 billion facility (US$832 million drawn) to support the on-going
operations and the expansion of the Group to enable it to pay its
debts as and when they fall due.
(iv)	The Directors of Yanzhou have provided a letter of support
whereby unless revoked by giving not less than 24 months’ notice,
for so long as Yanzhou owns at least 51% of the shares of Yancoal,
Yanzhou will ensure that Yancoal continues to operate so that it
remains solvent.
