QUEENSLAND
ANNUAL REPORT 2017         25
Middlemount has contracted rail and port capacity through
Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal and Abbot Point Port.
The Middlemount joint venture overcame the impacts of poor
weather conditions and subsequent interruptions to rail and
shipping to re-establish consistent extraction and throughput rates
in the second half of the year.
Middlemount achieved total annual ROM coal production of
5.3Mt (2016 5.3Mt) and total saleable coal production of 3.9Mt
(2016 4.1Mt).
Middlemount is an open cut mine located 90 kilometres north-east
of Emerald in Queensland’s Bowen Basin. Full scale operations
at the open cut mine commenced in November 2011, with mining
activities using conventional truck and shovel techniques.
Yarrabee production was in accordance with forecasts, the
operation adjusting product type in the second half of the year
to capitalise on increasing price opportunities and market
demand for PCI coal.
Yarrabee achieved total ROM coal production of 3.4Mt (2016
3.6Mt) and total saleable coal production of 2.9Mt (2016 3.1Mt).
Acquired as part of Felix Resources Pty Ltd in December 2009,
the Yarrabee open cut coal mine is located approximately
40 kilometres north-east of Blackwater in Central Queensland’s
Bowen Basin.
