(iii) Interest rate risk
The Group is subject to interest rate risk that arises from borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash. Generally, no variable
interest is receivable or payable on the Group’s trade and other receivables or payables where applicable as they are fixed in nature and therefore
they are not exposed to the interest rate risk.
The Group’s cash flow interest rate risk for assets primarily arises from cash at bank and deposits subject to market bank rates. Floating rate
borrowings bearing LIBOR rates are re-set on a quarterly basis.
The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk and the weighted average interest rate is set out as below:

Sensitivity
The following table summarises the sensitivity of the Group’s significant financial assets and liabilities to changes in variable interest rates. This
sensitivity is based on reasonably possible changes, determined using observed historical interest rate movements for the preceding five year
period, with a heavier weighting given to more recent market data. Past movements are not necessarily indicative of future movements. For
financial assets, a 25 basis point (decrease)/increase in interest rates would have (decreased)/increased equity and profit or loss after tax by the
amounts shown below. For financial liabilities, a 25 basis point (decrease)/increase in interest rates would have increased/(decreased) equity and
profit or loss after tax by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.
