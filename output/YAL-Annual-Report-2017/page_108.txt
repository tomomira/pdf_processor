(a) Risk exposure
The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk and credit risk is discussed in Note D8. The maximum exposure to credit risk on the cash and cash
equivalents balance at the end of the reporting period is the carrying amount of each class of cash and cash equivalents mentioned above.
C7 TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES
Accounting Policy
Trade and other receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the reporting period which are classified
as non-current assets. After initial recognition, trade and other receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Critical accounting estimate and judgements
The recoverable amount of Wiggins Island Preference Securities and Gladstone Long Term Securities, is estimated based on expected
future cashflows. WICET is currently re-negotiating its senior debt facility that could result in a change to those expected future cashflows.
