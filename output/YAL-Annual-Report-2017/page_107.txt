C5 INTANGIBLES
Accounting Policies
(i) Goodwill
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is recognised at cost and subsequently measured at cost less any impairment losses.
The cost represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.
See Note C3 for further details on impairment of assets.
(ii) Computer software
Computer software is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is calculated on
a straight-line basis over the period of expected benefit, which ranges from 2.5 to 10 years.
(iii) Access, water rights and other mining licences
Access rights and other mining licences have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated
impairment losses. Water rights have been recognised at cost and are assessed annually for impairment. The water rights have been
determined to have an indefinite useful life. Amortisation of access rights and other mining licences is calculated as the shorter of the life of the
mine or agreement using a units of production basis in tonnes, or on a straight-line basis. The estimated useful lives vary from 10 to 25 years.
(iv) Other
In acquiring Coal & Allied in 2017 under AASB3 Business Combinations an asset was recognised for management fees charged to Port
Waratah Coal Services Pty Ltd. The intangible asset will be released to the profit and loss on a straight line basis.

The goodwill at 31 December 2017 relates to the acquisition of Yancoal Resources Limited (formally known as Felix Resources Limited) from an
independent third party in an arm’s length transaction and was allocated to the Yarrabee mine. Refer to Note C3 for the details regarding the fair
value less cost to sell calculation performed at 31 December 2017. The CGU for which goodwill was allocated was not subject to an impairment
charge as the recoverable amount is greater than the carrying value for this CGU.
