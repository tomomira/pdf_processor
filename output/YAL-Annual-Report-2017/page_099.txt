B7 PROFIT AND LOSS PER SHARE
Accounting Policies
(a) Basic profit/(loss) per share
Calculated as net profit/(loss) attributable to members of the parent, adjusted to exclude any costs of servicing equity (other than dividends)
and preference shares dividends, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares, adjusted for any bonus element.
(b) Diluted profit/(loss) per share
Calculated as net profit/(loss) attributable to members of the parent, adjusted for costs of servicing equity (other than dividends); the after-
tax effect of dividends and interest associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares that have been recognised as expenses; and other
non-discretionary changes in revenues or expenses during the period that would result from the dilution of potential ordinary shares, divided
by the weighted average number of ordinary shares and dilutive potential ordinary shares, adjusted for any bonus element.
