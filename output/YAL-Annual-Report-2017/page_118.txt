D6 HEDGE RESERVE
Accounting Policy
When a financial instrument is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the
hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging reserve until the anticipated underlying
transaction occurs. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, or is sold, terminated or expires, any accumulated gain or loss
remains in equity until the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to
occur, then the amount accumulated in equity is immediately recognised in profit or loss.
The collar option contracts entered into by the Group are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges.
