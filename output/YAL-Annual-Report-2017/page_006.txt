OPERATING PERFORMANCE
The addition of attributable production from the
newly acquired Mount Thorley Warkworth and Hunter
Valley Operations mines generated an immediate
and significant increase in production, achieving total
saleable coal production of 31.5Mt (23.4Mt equity
share) for the year (31 December 2016: 16.0Mt
equity share) and total Run of Mine (“ROM”) coal
production of 41.1Mt (30.6Mt equity share) for the
year (31 December 2016: 21.2Mt equity share).
Yancoal achieved total coal sales (equity share)
of 28.5Mt1 for the year (31 December 2016: 19.3Mt),
with a sales split (equity share) for the period
of 19.6Mt (2016 11.6Mt) thermal coal and 8.99Mt
(2016 7.7Mt) metallurgical coal.
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Yancoal achieved a total operating EBIT of $732 million
before tax, up $693 million on the year prior.
Yancoal’s financial improvement was mostly
attributable to the strategic acquisition of 100%
of Coal & Allied Industries Limited from Rio Tinto for
US$2.69 billion in value, as at 1 September 2017,
resulting in a significant increase in production.
Increased production output at a time of industry-high
benchmark prices for semi-soft coking and thermal
coals led Yancoal’s recovery to announce a profit after
tax of $229 million from revenue of $2.6 billion for the
year ended 31 December 2017.
