CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT    ANNUAL REPORT 2017      73
In 2017, the Audit and Risk Management Committee had in place
a framework to identify and manage material business risks. This
framework includes:
––
identification of material business risk by the Executive Committee
by reference to a single risk register, approved by the Audit and
Risk Management Committee and Board;
––
implementation of a risk management framework (that includes
a risk management policy, governance structure, procedures),
approved by the Audit and Risk Management Committee
and Board;
––
formal risk identification activities being undertaken at both a
functional level and at each of the Company’s mine sites;
––
designated individuals across the business that have accountability
for the implementation of risk management within their areas
of responsibility;
––
the EGM of Risk Management and Auditing as a central resource
available to assist with all risk management responsibilities, and to
assist with any training/awareness or other related requirements;
and
––
adherence to internal procedures and plans for crisis management.
The Audit and Risk Management Committee receives periodic reports
on the performance of the Company’s risk management framework,
as well as on the Company’s key risk exposures to satisfy itself that it
continues to be sound. A review of the risk management framework
was conducted in 2017.
Formal risk identification activities are undertaken on an annual basis
as part of the 5-year Strategic Planning Process undertaken each
year; with Risk Identification and Analysis undertaken at a functional
level, as well as at each of the organisation’s mine sites. In addition,
where appropriate, project specific risk assessments are conducted.
The EGM of Risk Management and Auditing is responsible for
establishing and managing the company wide risk management
system, risk management framework and practices, reviewing the
impact of the risk management framework on its control environment
and insurance arrangements and reviewing the risk of major
investment projects. Together with the CEC, the Board and the Audit
and Risk Management Committee, the EGM of Risk Management
and Auditing is responsible for developing a risk matrix and framework
and for implementing related risk assurance processes and audits of
compliance for the Company and its subsidiaries.
The responsibility for managing risks, risk controls or risk management
action plans is embedded within the business and undertaken as part
of everyday activities.
Risks associated with the Company
The future operating performance of the Group may be affected by
risks relating to the Company’s business. Some of these risks are
specific to the Company while others relate to economic conditions
and the general industry and markets in which the Company operates.
The Company’s risk management policies and procedures have
been designed and implemented to identify, manage and mitigate
any exposure to risks relating to the Company’s business, including
economic, environmental and social sustainability risks. The Company
undertakes regular monitoring and assessment of these risks and
implements risk mitigation strategies to minimise its exposure to such
risks. However, there can be no assurance that such risk mitigation
strategies will protect the Company from these risks. Other risks
are beyond the Company’s control and cannot be mitigated. The
occurrence of any such risks could adversely affect the Company’s
financial condition and performance. The risks listed below are
not purported to be exhaustive and there is no assurance that
the importance of different risks will not change or other risks will
not emerge.
The table below identifies risks which are considered to be economic,
environmental and/or social sustainability risks.
