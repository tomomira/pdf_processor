(i) Investment in associates
Newcastle Coal Infrastructure Group Pty Ltd
The Group holds 27% (2016: 27%) of the ordinary shares of Newcastle Coal Infrastructure Group Pty Ltd (“NCIG”). Under the shareholder
agreement between the Group and other shareholders, the Group has 27% of the voting power of NCIG. The Group has the right to appoint a
director and is currently represented on the Board to partake in policy-making processes.
Watagan Mining Company Pty Ltd
During 2015 the Group established a 100% owned subsidiary, Watagan Mining Company Pty Ltd (“Watagan”). On 18 February 2016, the
Group executed a Bond Subscription Agreement, together with other agreements (the “Watagan Agreements”) that, on completion, transferred
the Group’s interest in three of its 100% owned NSW coal mining operations, being the Austar, Ashton and Donaldson coal mines (the “three
mines”), to Watagan for a purchase price of $1,363.4 million (an amount equal to the book value of the three mines at completion). The purchase
price was funded by way of a $1,363.4 million loan from Yancoal Australia Ltd to Watagan bearing interest at BBSY plus 7.06% with a maturity
date of 1 April 2025. The outstanding interest and principal of this loan is guaranteed by Yankuang Group Co., Ltd (“Yankuang”), the Group’s
ultimate parent entity. The completion date of the transaction was 31 March 2016.
On completion Watagan issued US$775 million of secured debt bonds with a term of approximately nine years to three external financiers
(“Bondholders”). The Bondholders will receive interest on the face value outstanding on the bonds comprising a fixed interest component, as
well as a variable interest component that is tied to the EBITDA performance of Watagan. Under the terms of the Watagan Agreements, it was
determined that upon issuance of the bonds the Group lost control of Watagan.
This loss of control was determined to occur on the issuance date of the bonds on the basis that the power over the key operating and strategic
decisions of Watagan no longer reside with the Group. Specifically, those powers were transferred to the Bondholders under the terms of the
Watagan Agreements as the Bondholders were given control of Watagan’s board of directors via appointment of the majority of directors. This
loss of control resulted in the Group de-consolidating the consolidated results of Watagan from the transaction completion date and the Group
began to equity account for its 100% equity interest in Watagan as an associate.
While Watagan is deconsolidated for accounting purposes, as a result of the Group’s ongoing 100% equity ownership it remains within the
Group’s tax consolidated group.
