Yancoal will continue to achieve
an increased production output of
high quality thermal and semi-soft
coals via its tier-one open cut
mines, while continuing to consider
new opportunities for organic and
strategic acquisitive growth.
The successful completion of the Coal &
Allied transaction and integration of the
Mount Thorley Warkworth and Hunter Valley
Operations mines into the Yancoal Group has
effectively doubled the production capacity
of the Company, with guidance for saleable
production in 2018 set at 35 – 37 million
tonnes (equity share). The forecast for 2018
capital expenditure is approximately
$247 million (equity share).
Now established as Australia’s largest pure-
play coal producer, Yancoal remains well-
positioned to meet increasing demand for high
quality thermal coal, sourcing product from
its three high-grade, low cost tier-one coal
assets: the Moolarben complex; Mt Thorley
Warkworth; and the proposed Hunter Valley
Operations joint venture.
At the time of publication, Yancoal expects
to complete the Hunter Valley Operations
joint venture arrangement with a subsidiary of
Glencore Coal Pty Ltd (“Glencore”) during the
first half of 2018, subject to approvals.
Yancoal continues to consider exploration
and development opportunities within existing
approvals for the Mount Thorley Warkworth
operation, Moolarben complex and Stratford
open cut.
In 2018, Yancoal will continue to maximise
blending across the New South Wales
operations, improve fleet efficiencies at its
open cut operations, and remains focused
on reducing its operating costs and existing
levels of debt.
