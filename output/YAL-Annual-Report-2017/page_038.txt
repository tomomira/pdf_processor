Note: Mt Thorley, Warkworth and HVO (Hunter Valley Operations) are new acquisitions, not previously reported by Yancoal (Reconciliations are not possible).
(1)	 The reported Coal Reserves totals within the JORC Reserve Reports utilised for public reporting are rounded (significant figure), whereas the Coal Reserve reconciliations
contained within them are based on the unrounded numbers, this adjustment is required to align the unrounded reconciliations with the significant figure rounded Coal
Reserve totals.
