Note: +ve = increase in reported Coal Resources, -ve = decrease in reported Coal Resources
Note: Mt Thorley, Warkworth and HVO (Hunter Valley Operations) are new acquisitions, not previously reported by Yancoal (Reconciliations are not possible).
(1)	 The reported Coal Resources totals within the JORC Resource Reports utilised for public reporting are rounded (significant figure), whereas the Coal Resource
reconciliations contained within them are based on the unrounded numbers, this adjustment is required to align the unrounded reconciliations with the significant figure
rounded Coal Resource totals.
