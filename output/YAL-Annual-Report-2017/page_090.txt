Accounting Policy
Management has determined the operating segments based on the strategic direction and organisational structure of the Group together
with reports reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Makers (“CODM”), defined as the Executive Committee, that are used to make
strategic decisions including resource allocation and assessment of segment performance.
The reportable segments are considered at a regional level being New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland (QLD).
Non-operating items of the Group are presented under the segment “Corporate” which includes administrative expenses, foreign exchange
