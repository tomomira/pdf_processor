3.4  Fixed Remuneration
Executives receive a Fixed Remuneration package, which incorporates cash salary, superannuation benefits and may include a provision for a
car allowance, together with certain other benefits. Executives have some scope to determine the combination of cash (including car allowance)
and certain non-monetary benefits by which their FAR is delivered, provided that it does not create undue cost for the Company.
Each Senior Executive’s’ level of fixed remuneration is reviewed annually to provide a base level of remuneration which is appropriate to the
position and competitive with companies in a similar industry referencing remuneration data from McDonald and Company (Australasia) Pty Ltd
(“McDonald Report”). No Executives are guaranteed an annual increase in FAR.
Executives have some scope to determine the combination of cash (including car allowance) and certain non-monetary benefits by which their
FAR is delivered, provided that it does not create undue cost for the Company.
3.5  Variable remuneration
Variable remuneration is delivered through participation in the STI Plan (as outlined in section 3.5.1) and a Special Incentive Scheme (as outlined
in section 3.5.2). Certain Executives are also eligible to participate in a LTI Plan (as outlined in section 3.5.5).
3.5.1 Short Term Incentive Plan
Eligibility
The STI Plan applies to Executives as well as to the broader management and employees of the Company.
Objective
The objective of the STI Plan is to reward Executives and employees for the achievements of the Company, Business Unit and individual goals
that are aligned to the Company’s financial, operational and strategic priorities.
Structure
For 2017 the STI Plan comprised three key components:
1.	 STI opportunity – this is expressed as a percentage of the Executive’s FAR. The STI opportunity is reviewed annually. A benchmarking
exercise is completed against comparable peers in listed companies, and no changes were proposed for 2017. The CEO and CEC have
an agreed STI opportunity of between a minimum of 0% and a maximum of 126% of FAR for 2017. The Board believes this level of STI
opportunity is reasonable and competitive for the current environment.
2.	 STI Scorecard – this consists of a number of Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”). For the Executives named in this report, all KPIs are
measured at the Company level. The KPIs fall into the following categories TRIFR (Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate) (25% weighting),
Environment (10% weighting), FOR (Free On Rail) Cash Costs (35% weighting), Profitability (20% weighting) and Specific Business Unit
Measures (10%). Details of how the STI Scorecard is evaluated are set out below. STI scorecard performance is assessed by the Chairman
of the Executive Committee and the Chief Executive Officer, reviewed by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, and approved by
the Board.
3.	 Individual Performance – this is measured by Key Result Areas (“KRA”). These KRAs are aligned to the Executive’s role and include areas
such as special projects, achievement of operating and capital expenditure budgets, and achievement of growth/continuous improvement
initiatives. Based on performance against the KRAs, the Executive receives a performance rating at the end of the year on a scale from
Exceptional to Below Standard. In the case of the Chief Executive Officer, individual performance is assessed by the Nomination and
Remuneration Committee, to be endorsed by the Board. For all other Executives, performance is assessed by the Chief Executive Officer and
the Chair of the Executive Committee.
