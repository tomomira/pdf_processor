E4 PARENT ENTITY FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Accounting Policy
(a) Investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements
Investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements are accounted for at cost less any impairment in the financial statements
of Yancoal Australia Ltd. Dividends received from associates are recognised in the parent entity’s profit or loss, rather than being deducted
from the carrying amount of these investments.
(b) Tax consolidation legislation
Yancoal Australia Ltd and its wholly-owned Australian controlled entities have implemented the tax consolidation legislation.
The head entity, Yancoal Australia Ltd, and the entities in the tax consolidated group account for their own current and deferred tax amounts.
These tax amounts are measured as if each entity in the tax consolidated group continues to be a stand alone taxpayer in its own right.
In addition to its own current and deferred tax amounts, Yancoal Australia Ltd also recognises the current tax liabilities (or assets) and the
deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses and unused tax credits assumed from controlled entities in the tax consolidated group.
The entities have also entered into a tax funding agreement under which the wholly-owned entities fully compensate Yancoal Australia Ltd for
any current tax payable assumed and are compensated by Yancoal Australia Ltd for any current tax receivable and deferred tax assets relating
to unused tax losses or unused tax credits that are transferred to Yancoal Australia Ltd under the tax consolidation legislation as loans between
entities. The funding amounts are determined by reference to the amounts recognised in the wholly-owned entities’ financial statements.
The amounts receivable/payable under the tax funding agreement are due upon receipt of the funding advice from the head entity, which is
issued as soon as practicable after the end of each financial year. The head entity may also require payment of interim funding amounts to
assist with its obligations to pay tax instalments.
Assets or liabilities arising under tax funding agreements with the tax consolidated entities are recognised as current amounts receivable
from or payable to other entities in the Group.
Any difference between the amounts assumed and amounts receivable or payable under the tax funding agreement are recognised as a
contribution to (or distribution from) wholly owned tax consolidated entities.
