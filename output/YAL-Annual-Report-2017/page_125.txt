(d) Fair value measurements
(i) Fair value hierarchy
The Group uses various methods in estimating the fair value of financial instruments. AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement requires disclosure of fair
value measurements by level in accordance with the following fair value measurement hierarchy:
(a)	 quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1);
(b)	 inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly
(derived from prices) (level 2); and
(c)	 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) (level 3).
The following table presents the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities measured and recognised at fair value at 31 December 2017 and
31 December 2016:
