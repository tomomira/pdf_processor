(e) Capital risk management
Total capital comprises total equity as shown on the balance sheet plus total interest bearing liabilities. The Group’s primary objectives when
managing capital are to ensure the continued ability to provide a consistent return for equity stakeholders through a combination of capital
growth and distributions and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. In order to achieve these objectives, the
Group seeks to maintain a debt to debt plus equity ratio (gearing ratio) that balances risks and returns at an acceptable level and also to
maintain a sufficient funding base to enable the Group to meet its working capital and strategic investment needs. In order to maintain or adjust
the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or
other equity instruments, repay debt or draw down additional debt.
