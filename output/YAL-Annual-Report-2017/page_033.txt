Note: 2017 Coal Resources have been rounded in line with the JORC Code and the Yancoal reporting standards to reflect the relative uncertainty of the estimates.
Note: All Coal Resources are inclusive of Coal Reserves and are reported on a 100% basis with Yancoal’s ownership percent reported for each deposit.
The attributable share total is the total Coal Resources when the Yancoal ownership percent is applied.
Note: No Resources are reported in regards to the Oakland’s Project acquired as part of the Coal & Allied acquisition, this project is currently under assessment by
Yancoal in regards to its potential.
Note: Coal Resources detailed in table are as at 31 December 2017, with the exception of (1)MTW & (1)HVO which are as at 31 December 2016
(No production depletions have been applied).
(1)	 (MTW) Mt Thorley Warkworth, (HVO) Hunter Valley Operations.
(2)	 Gloucester comprises the Stratford, Duralie and Grant & Chainey deposits.
(3)	 The Middlemount JORC Coal Resource report was generated in March 2013 and excluded coal mined to 31 December 2012 (2.8Mt). A production depletion has been
applied to the reported Coal Resources by the Competent Person using the mined-out polygons as at the end of December 2017, the reported Coal Resources are
therefore as at end December 2017 based on this depletion.
(4)	 New acquisition, not previously reported by Yancoal (Reconciliations are not possible).
(5)	 On 17 February 2016, Yancoal announced a new financing arrangement to secure up to US$950 million in debt-funding via the issuing of nine-year secured debt bonds
by a newly established Yancoal subsidiary, Watagan Mining Company Pty Ltd (“Watagan”), to Industrial Bank Co. Ltd, BOCI Financial Products Limited and United NSW
Energy Limited. Under the arrangement, Yancoal’s interests in the assets of Ashton, Austar and Donaldson were transferred to and held by Watagan.
