Provision
Description
Employee benefits
The provision for employee benefits represents long service leave and annual leave entitlements and other incentives
accrued by employees.
Rehabilitation costs
Mining lease agreements and exploration permits impose obligations on the Group to rehabilitate areas where mining
activity has taken place. Rehabilitation of these areas is ongoing and in some cases will continue until 2060. The
provision for rehabilitation costs has been calculation based on the present value of the future costs expected to be
incurred in restoring affected mining areas, assuming current technologies.
Key estimate and judgement:
The rehabilitation provision has been created based on management’s internal estimates and assumptions relating
to the current economic environment, which management believes is a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the
future liability.
These estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions, however actual
rehabilitation costs will ultimately depend upon the future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works and
the timing of when the rehabilitation costs are incurred. Timing is dependent upon when the mines ceases to produce at
economically viable rates, which in turn, will depend upon future coal prices, which are inherently uncertain.
Take or pay
In acquiring part of a business or operation, an assessment is made on the fair value of the assets and liabilities under
AASB 3 Business Combinations. Take or pay is the assessment of forecast excess capacity for port and rail contracts.
A provision was recognised for the discounted estimated excess capacity. The provision has a finite life and will be
released to profit or loss over the period in which excess capacity is realised.
Key estimate and judgement:
The provision is recognised and estimated based on management’s assessment of contracted port capacity versus
forecast usage. This involves making assumptions about the probability, amount and timing of an outflow of resources
embodying economic benefits.
Sales contract
In acquiring part of a business or operation, an assessment is made on the fair value of the assets and liabilities under
AASB 3 Business Combinations. The sales contract provision is the assessment of a coal supply and transportation
agreement to supply coal to BLCP Power Limited in Thailand at below market prices. A provision was recognised for the
discounted estimated variance between contract and market prices. The provision has a finite life and will be released to
profit or loss over the contract term.
Key estimate and judgement:
The provision is recognised and estimated based on management’s assessment of future market prices.
Other provisions
The provision includes marketing services fee payable to Noble Group Limited deemed above market norms, contingent
royalties payable to Rio Tinto Plc assessed as part of the Coal & Allied acquisition in 2017 which will be amortised over
the contract term, and make good provisions to cover the cost to ‘make good’ any hired equipment, in case any major
overhaul costs are incurred at the end of the lease period.
