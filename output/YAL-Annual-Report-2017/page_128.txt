The accounting for the acquisition has been determined on a provisional basis at 31 December 2017. Any adjustments to the provisional values
as a result of completing work on the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired will be recognised within 12 months of the acquisition date and
will be recognised as if they had occurred as at the date of acquisition.
The preliminary assessment of the contingent royalty included in the entitlement offer booklet was that it formed part of the purchase
consideration. Having performed a more detailed assessment it has been determined the contingent royalty obligation represents a liability of the
acquired group as it is payable by subsidiaries of Coal & Allied and is included in provisions above.
(ii) Gain on acquisition of subsidiaries
The Company recognised a gain on acquisition of $177 million in other income in the profit and loss for the year ended 31 December 2017.
The acquisition resulted in a gain due to the fair value of the mine assets acquired benefiting from improved valuation assumptions on completion
date compared to the date the acquisition price was struck.
(iii) Revenue and profit contribution
The acquired interest contributed revenue of $749 million and net profit of $215 million to the Group for the period from 1 September 2017 to
31 December 2017. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2017, consolidated revenue and net profit for the period ended 31 December
2017 would have been $2,173 million and $818 million respectively. These amounts have been calculated using the Group’s accounting policies.
