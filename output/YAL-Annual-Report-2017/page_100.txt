In 2016, the potential conversion of subordinated capital notes into ordinary shares has an anti-dilutive impact as the Group was loss making
and was therefore excluded from the weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of diluted loss per share.
As disclosed in Note D4 18,000,181,437 shares were issued during 2017 for the conversion of SCNs and are included in the basic and diluted
weighted average calculation for 2017. At 31 December 2017 there are 4,900 SCNs on issue. As the SCNs were redeemed on 31 January 2018
they have been excluded from the above calculation.
Additionally as required by AASB133 when there is a rights issue, shares on issue prior to the rights issue need to be increased by a bonus
factor equal to the fair value per share immediately before the exercise of rights and the rights issue price. In the calculation above this factor
accounts to 10%.
