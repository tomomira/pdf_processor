Natural cash flow hedge
The Group currently does not use bank issued instruments to hedge foreign exchange risks in respect of US dollar denominated loans, however,
the scheduled repayment of the principal on US dollar loans is designated to hedge the cash flow risks on the portion of forecast US dollar
sales that are not hedged through bank issued instruments (“natural cash flow hedge”). US dollar loan repayments up to a six-month period are
designated to hedge the forecast US dollar sales during the same period after the designation of the hedge relationship based on a dollar for
dollar basis until the hedge ratio reaches one.
Hedging effectiveness is determined by comparing the changes in the hedging instruments and hedged sales. Hedge ineffectiveness will occur
when cash flows generated by sales transactions are lower than the forecast sales transaction. In cases of hedge ineffectiveness, gains or
losses in relation to the excess portion in the foreign exchange movement of the designated US dollar loan repayment will be recycled to profit
or loss. The effective portion of changes in the hedging instruments will be recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve in Other Comprehensive
Income. When the sales transactions occur, amounts accumulated in equity are recycled through the profit or loss as an increase or decrease to
sales revenue.
Royalty receivable
The royalty receivable from the Middlemount Joint Venture is estimated based on expected future cash flows that are dependent on sales
volumes, US dollar denominated coal prices and the US dollar foreign exchange rate (refer to Note C9).
Other assets
Other assets include the US$10 million associated with the Warkworth Call Option expected to complete in March 2018, and the promissory
note receivable as discussed in Note C7(i). These balances are predominantly held in US dollars and expected to settle within 12 months.
Non-contingent royalty payable
As discussed in Note E1 the Company has agreed to make deferred non-contingent royalty payments to Rio Tinto Plc (“Rio Tinto”) in US dollars.
The Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk at the end of the reporting period, expressed in Australian dollars, was as follows:

The cash and cash equivalents balance in RMB was $1.6 million on 18 January 2018. No foreign exchange risk for sensitivity analysis has been performed in 2017 due to
the immaterial position subsequent to year end.
Sensitivity
The following table summarises the sensitivity of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities to a reasonable possible change in the US dollar
exchange rate. The Group’s exposure to other foreign exchange movements is not material. The Group has used the observed range of actual
historical rates for the preceding five year period, with a heavier weighting placed on recently observed market data, in determining reasonably
possible exchange movements to be used for the current year’s sensitivity analysis. Past movements are not necessarily indicative of future
movements. A 10% depreciation/appreciation of the Australian dollar against the US dollar would have (decreased)/increased equity and profit or
loss after tax by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.
