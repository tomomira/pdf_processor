      "text_content": "TURNAROUND\nThe substantial cash flows generated from\nthe acquired Coal & Allied assets, combined\nwith the associated operational synergies\nand benefits of our equity raising, have\nimmediately and materially strengthened\nYancoal’s balance sheet.\nIt is with great pleasure we have announced\nYancoal’s recovery to profit, achieving a total\noperating EBIT of $732 million before tax, up\n$693 million on the year prior, and a profit after\ntax of $229 million from revenue of $2.6 billion.\nThis significant turnaround is mostly attributable\nto the successful completion of the Coal\n& Allied transaction at a time of increasing\npricing strength and sustainability across the\nmetallurgical and thermal coal markets.\nPRODUCTION INCREASE\nThe addition of attributable production from\nthe newly acquired Mount Thorley Warkworth\nand Hunter Valley Operations mines generated\nan immediate and significant increase in\nproduction, allowing Yancoal to maximise\nsales and blending at a time of benchmark-high\npricing for semi-soft and thermal coals with\nkey buyers.\nYancoal achieved total saleable coal production\nof 31.5Mt (23.4Mt equity share) for the year\n(31 December 2016: 16.0Mt equity share) and\ntotal Run of Mine (“ROM”) coal production of\n41.1Mt (30.6Mt equity share) for the year\n(31 December 2016: 21.2Mt equity share).\nSuch a strong production result includes only\nfour months of attributable activity from the\nnewly acquired tier-one assets and clearly\ndemonstrates Yancoal is very well positioned to\nrealise significant value for our shareholders in\nthe years ahead.\nCombining the world-class assets of Coal &\nAllied’s Mount Thorley Warkworth and Hunter\nValley Operations with the Company’s existing\nportfolio, the acquisition enables the maximising\nof synergies between Yancoal assets and\nsupports the Company’s vision for continued\nmarket growth.\nTHE ACQUISITION\nCritically, we approached our competitive\nbid for Coal & Allied with a commitment to\npricing-discipline, ensuring we negotiated a\ncommercially robust offer in the best interests\nof all parties of US$2.45 billion cash payable\non completion, plus US$240 million in future\nnon-contingent royalty payments over five years\nfollowing completion, and a coal price linked\ncontingent royalty.\nTo support the funding of the acquisition,\nYancoal also conducted a pro-rata\nrenounceable entitlement offer of\n23,464,929,520 fully paid ordinary shares\nto raise US$2.35 billion, and an associated\nplacement of 1,500,000,000 fully paid ordinary\nshares to raise a further US$150 million.\nThe pro-rata entitlement offer attracted new\ninvestors, provided greater depth to our\nshareholder base, and efficiently generated\nthe necessary funding to support the next\nstage of our business’ evolution.\nAt the same time, Yancoal also entered into\na binding agreement to establish a 51:49\nunincorporated joint venture with Glencore in\nrelation to the Hunter Valley Operations asset,\nfollowing completion of the acquisition.\nThe joint venture arrangement provides\nsignificant combined synergies and\ncommercial opportunities for both Yancoal\nand Glencore, with shareholders set to\nbenefit from the co-operative management\nexperience and operational skills of two\nof Australia’s leading coal producers. The\njoint venture remains subject to Glencore\nachieving all required approvals.\nSHAREHOLDER SUPPORT\nThroughout the transaction Yancoal operated\nswiftly and with certainty, supported by our\nmajority shareholder, Yanzhou Coal Mining\nCompany Ltd, and Yanzhou’s 56 percent\nshareholder, Yankuang Group Company Ltd.\nYanzhou shares Yancoal’s commitment to\ncontinuous improvement and a belief in\noperating to the highest standards of safety,\nintegrity, excellence and with respect for our\npeople and the countries in which we operate.\nWith their continued investment and that of\nour new second-largest shareholder Cinda\nInternational HGB Investment (UK) Limited,\nwe have demonstrated Yancoal’s long term\ncommitment to the local resources sector as a\nsignificant employer and exporter for Australia.\nInvesting within Australia requires flexibility,\nbravery, certainty and an ability to trust the\nmanagement team working within the country.\nThe strategic acquisition of Coal & Allied is a\ncredit to the management teams of Yancoal\nand our majority shareholders.\nOPERATIONAL STRENGTH\nFollowing the completion of the transaction on\n1 September 2017, we have successfully and\nefficiently integrated the people, processes\nand systems of the newly acquired assets into\nthe Yancoal Group. Sharing our values and\ncore operating principles across operations to\nensure we are culturally aligned and focused\non achieving our production goals for the\nyear ahead.\nWith this transaction Yancoal’s Board\nand executive have increased the capability\nand capacity required to generate new\norganic growth.\nWe have also maintained our strength in\nproject management, completing the Stage\nTwo Moolarben underground mine ahead of\nschedule and below budget, commencing\nlongwall mining in October.\nOur strategic decision to commit to the\ndevelopment of the Moolarben Stage Two\nProject in 2014 during the global coal market\ndownturn, has appropriately prepared our\nbusiness to respond swiftly and with surety\nto the recent price recovery.\nWe are now reaping the benefits of our early\nproject investment and belief in the long-term\nreturn of the global market, understanding\nthe risks and opportunities of the mining cycle.\nMOVING FORWARD\nWhile there is much work ahead for all of our\nteams, we retain a positive outlook towards\nthe continued improvement within established\nand untapped developing global coal markets.\nWe also continue to focus on achieving our\ngoal of operating without injury and achieving\ncost-efficiencies across the Group.\nOn behalf of the Board I would like to thank\nour people for their drive and dedication to\nsafe production and instituting the highest\noperating standards.\nTogether, our people have fortified Yancoal\nagainst recent years of turbulent market\nforces and challenging operating conditions\nto overcome and establish our business as\na true global market leader.\nWith the support of our majority shareholders\nand our joint venture and marketing partners,\nYancoal Australia has the leadership, asset\nportfolio, experience, and long term strategy\nrequired to build a brighter future for all.\nAs we enter 2018, Yancoal is ready for the\nnext exciting step in our continuing journey.\n$732M\nUP $693M\nTOTAL OPERATING EBIT\nFOR 2017\nANNUAL REPORT 2017         9",

      "text_content": "The expansion of our open cut portfolio at\na time of sustained market price improvements\nhas enabled Yancoal to achieve significant\nproduction gains well beyond our pre-\nacquisition performance.\nWORKING TOGETHER\nOnly three years ago Yancoal was operating\nin a deflated and disappointing resources\nmarket, restructuring our operations\nand managing costs to ensure we were\nready for an eventual upturn.\nAs prices improved throughout the past year,\nwe have held true to our promises to continue\nto invest into the Australian resources sector,\nemploy from the areas in which we operate,\nand remain absolutely committed to operating\nsafely and transparently.\nOur transformative acquisition has required\na whole-of-business commitment and\nits successful completion is of credit to our\npeople and their ability to anticipate, respond\nand recalibrate to market forces and\noperational demands.\nTogether, we have secured Yancoal’s future as\nAustralia’s largest pure-play coal producer, with\nmajority interests in two of the country’s leading\ntier-one large-scale, long-life and low-cost open\ncut coal mines, adding to the strength of our\nestablished tier-one Moolarben complex.\nSAFETY\nAs we have increased in scale, we have\nremained focused on ensuring the safety of our\npeople. Remaining ever vigilant in ensuring we\nare providing a safe workplace for the more than\n5,000 people directly responsible for helping\nYancoal achieve its ongoing market success.\nTo support this commitment, we continue to\nimplement safety training and incident response\npractices across each of our operations,\nincluding the 2017 introduction of a Critical\nControls initiative to identify and mitigate against\nsignificant on-site risks.\nOnly through continued training, education\nand awareness can we help to ensure each\nof our people returns home safely. There are\nno shortcuts to safety and it is the responsibility\nof every person within our business to be\nwatching out for themselves and those working\nalongside them.\nWe must never compromise on safety.\nTRANSFORMATION\nWith our management and operational\nteams successfully integrating the Mount\nThorley Warkworth and Hunter Valley\nOperations assets into our business from\nday one, we have immediately benefitted\nfrom operational synergies and the creation\nof new marketing opportunities.\nThe Company’s balance sheet strengthened\nvia increased cashflows from a full fourth\nquarter’s contribution of attributable new coal\nproduct sales.\nSales volumes for the fourth quarter reporting\nperiod were up 83 percent on the year prior;\nincluding 3.45 million tonnes, a 56 percent\ncontribution to the year-on-year increase,\nfrom Hunter Valley Operations and Mount\nThorley Warkworth.\nOPERATIONS\nDuring the year, we achieved a series of\nkey milestones essential to the next stage\nof Yancoal’s continued growth, both organic\nand via strategic acquisition.\nOf specific note, we completed the\ncommissioning of the Moolarben Stage Two\nunderground mine ahead of time and below\nbudget, commencing longwall production\nin October.\nThe completion of the Stage Two expansion,\nconsisting of two open cut pits and the\nnew underground, has now established the\nMoolarben complex as a leading operation\nin New South Wales, benefitting from fleet\nefficiencies introduced in the year prior and\nachieving superior extraction rates both\nabove and below ground.\nSimultaneously, we have also maintained\nthe necessary operational flexibility and\ndiscipline required to adapt the mine plans\nof our Stratford Duralie and Yarrabee open\ncuts throughout the year to successfully\nimprove extraction rates, reduce costs\nand more efficiently meet changing global\nmarket demands.\nCOMMUNITY\nEmploying the majority of our people from the\nareas in which we operate, and relying on local\ncontractors and service providers to support\nour operations, we remain ever mindful of our\nresponsibilities across regional Australia.\nIt is up to each of our operations to keep our\nlocal communities engaged and informed.\nOperating to the highest environmental and\nsafety standards, while communicating openly\nand transparently. We cannot continue to grow\nunless our local stakeholders are considered\nin our decision-making.\nWe must also continue to play an important\nrole in financially contributing to local and\nregional employment, training, health and\neducation initiatives we believe capable of\nmaking a positive difference.\nWithin the past year we have contributed\nmore than $1.3m to community-focused\ninitiatives via our Community Support\nProgram and I look forward to our new\noperations playing a major role in supporting\nand establishing viable and sustainable\nregional programs.\nTHE YEAR AHEAD\nRenewed global demand for high quality\ncoal, buoyed by improved coal prices will\ncontinue to strengthen Yancoal’s performance\nas we progress the development of our\nopen cut operations and continue to pursue\nnew marketing and blending opportunities.\nMoving forward, we are well advanced in\nour preparations for the eventual\nimplementation of our joint venture with\nGlencore at Hunter Valley Operations,\nsubject to final approvals.\nThe joint venture will ultimately provide\nHunter Valley Operations with the opportunity\nto benefit from substantial synergies from\nGlencore’s adjoining operations and both\nparties look forward to working together to\ndrive new market growth.\nVia the transaction we have also attained a\n36.5% share of ownership of Port Waratah\nCoal Services Limited.\nAUSTRALIA’S LARGEST PURE-PLAY\nCOAL PRODUCER\nWe are now an established leader within the\nAustralian resources sector and have clearly\ndemonstrated we have the capabilities,\nexperience and initiative to exceed\nexpectations within the global marketplace.\nThis is a new day, a new opportunity and I\nwould like to thank the Yancoal team and our\nshareholders for their continuing contribution\nto our growth and success.\nLooking ahead, there is still much to achieve.\n31.5Mt\nUP FROM 19.8Mt\nSALEABLE COAL PRODUCTION\nFOR 2017 (100% BASIS)\nANNUAL REPORT 2017         13",

Ltd,\nor a third-party mine.\nOUTLOOK\nRecent increases in metallurgical coal prices\nare expected to hold, allowing for ongoing\nprice strength, as high demand for hard\ncoking coal across China, India, Europe and\nSouth America remains. The global market is\nbenefiting from high steel prices in 2017 and\nsustained construction rates in China, despite\nthe introduction of environmental restrictions\nin the winter months.\nIn contrast, thermal coal markets face\npotential price volatility in the year ahead,\nas increased market competition from South\nAfrican and Colombian coals into the Asian\nseaborne market, aiming to benefit from\nrecent higher thermal prices, will place further\npressure on Australian coal sale opportunities.\nChina’s import of low grade thermal coal\nis expected to remain relatively strong and\nconsistent with 2017 levels, while solid\nmarket growth opportunities exist within\nSouth East Asia and the Subcontinent.\nYancoal remains focused on end-users\nin the prime target markets of China, Korea\nand Japan, while maximising new sales\nopportunities generated via the acquisition\nof the Mount Thorley Warkworth and Hunter\nValley Operations mines, including the\nmarketing of semi-soft coal products into\nIndia and Europe and premium thermal coals\nacross Asian markets.\n2017 experienced sustained global\ncoal market price improvements, with\nindustry-high benchmark prices for\nsemi-soft coking and thermal coals\nachieved during the reporting period.\nGUIDANCE\n2018 guidance for saleable production is\n35 – 37 million tonnes (equity share1).\n1\tIncludes Watagan (100%), Middlemount (49.9997%), Yarrabee\n(100%), Stratford Duralie (100%), Moolarben (81%), Mount\nThorley Warkworth (82.9% from 1 March 2018), and Hunter\nValley Operations (51% on the basis that Glencore will be\nentitled to a 49% interest in Hunter Valley Operations with\neconomic effect from 1 September 2017 on implementation of\nthe Hunter Valley Operations Joint Venture).

Yancoal remains committed to proactively improving\nthe systems and processes employed across sites to educate,\ncommunicate and record employee safety initiatives.\nUnder the direction of the Health, Safety and Environment Committee,\nYancoal continues to build the leadership, capabilities, systems and\nreporting procedures required to deliver on its objectives of achieving\nzero harm at its operations.\nFinancial performance\nYancoal achieved a total operating EBIT of $732 million before tax, up\n$693 million on the year prior.\nYancoal’s financial improvement is directly attributable to the strategic\nacquisition of 100% of Coal & Allied Industries Limited (“Coal & Allied”)\nfrom Rio Tinto for US$2.69 billion in value, as at 1 September 2017,\n1\t Yancoal’s interest in HVO will reduce to 51% on completion of the Glencore Transaction. Completion of the Glencore Transaction is subject to a number of conditions\nprecedent that have not been satisfied as at the date of this announcement.\nresulting in a significant increase in production output at a time of\nglobal coal market price improvements.\nIncreased production output at a time of industry-high benchmark\nprices for semi-soft coking and thermal coals led Yancoal’s recovery to\nannounce a profit after tax of $229 million from revenue of $2.6 billion\n(before tax) for the full year ended 31 December 2017.\nYancoal conducted a pro-rata renounceable entitlement offer\n(“Entitlement Offer”) of 23,464,929,520 fully paid ordinary shares to\nraise US$2.35 billion, and an associated placement of 1,500,000,000\nfully paid ordinary shares (“the Placement”) to raise a further\nUS$150 million, to support the funding of the Coal & Allied acquisition.\nYancoal maximised sales volumes and new blending opportunities\nacross assets, benefitting from a full quarter’s attributable production\nfrom the acquired Coal & Allied assets, post-completion in\nSeptember 2017.\nPost-acquisition earnings enabled the Company to recover both\nstamp duty and transaction costs, with Yancoal subsequently paying\ndown US$150 million in loans to Bank of China.\nThroughout 2017, Yancoal continued to implement cost reduction\nstrategies across all operations, addressed existing take-or-pay\narrangements, and blended products across the New South\nWales operations (both managed and operated) to meet new\nmarket opportunities.\nCorporate activities\nOn 1 September 2017, Yancoal became Australia’s largest pure-\nplay coal producer, effectively doubling its production output and\nincreasing its coal product offerings via the completion of the strategic\nacquisition of 100% of Coal & Allied Industries Limited (“Coal & Allied”)\nfrom Rio Tinto for US$2.69 billion in value.\nCombining the world-class assets of Coal & Allied’s Mount Thorley\nWarkworth and Hunter Valley Operations with the Company’s existing\nportfolio, the acquisition enables the maximising of synergies between\nYancoal assets and supports the Company’s vision for continued\nmarket growth.\nYancoal’s binding agreement for US$2.69 billion in value comprised\nUS$2.45 billion cash payable on completion, US$240 million in future\nnon-contingent royalty payments over five years following completion,\nand a coal price linked contingent royalty.\nOn completion, the Company acquired the following interests in two\nof the country’s leading tier-one large-scale, long-life and low-cost\ncoal mines located in the Hunter Valley region of New South Wales, as\nwell as required export infrastructure:\n––\na 67.6% interest in the Hunter Valley Operations mining complex\n(“HVO”)1;\n––\nan 80.0% interest in the Mt Thorley mine and a 55.6% interest in\nthe Warkworth mine (together, “MTW”); and\n––\na 36.5% interest in Port Waratah Coal Services (“PWCS”), a coal\nexport terminal located at the Port of Newcastle.\nOn 27 July 2017, Yancoal entered into a binding agreement to\nestablish a 51:49 unincorporated joint venture with Glencore Coal Pty\nLtd (“Glencore”) in relation to Hunter Valley Operations (“HVO JV”),\nfollowing completion of Yancoal’s acquisition of Coal & Allied.",

The company has also\nsuccessfully completed the Coal & Allied transaction which was a transformative project. Consequently, our remuneration structure reflects a\nbusiness in transition.\nPrograms were developed to reward specific major milestones and projects as they were accomplished.\n––\nA break-even bonus to focus the executives’ attention on driving towards profitability;\n––\nTransaction bonus – a special incentive to reward those actively involved in the acquisition of the Coal & Allied business over the last two and\nhalf years.\nThe Board considers the success of each these was fundamental to growing shareholder value. The benefits from these special incentives have\nbeen recognized in FY 2017 accounts and will be paid to the participants during 2018.\nHaving laid the foundations for our business going forward we are in the process of reviewing the strategy and structure of remuneration.\nWe expect the outcome of this review during 2018 will be executive remuneration arrangements that are competitive, consistent with\ncontemporary market practice and tailored to align with Yancoal’s short and long term strategic objectives. The right balance of well-constructed\nperformance based on short and long term incentives delivered in cash and equity is expected to eliminate the need for special project\nincentives beyond 2018.\nThis report sets out remuneration information for the Company’s Key Management Personnel for the 12 months ended 31 December 2017.\nYours sincerely,\nXiyong Li\nChairman of the Board,\nChair of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee",

On these issues, the Board receives recommendations from the\nNomination and Remuneration Committee.\nThe Nomination and Remuneration Committee’s objective is to assist the Board by making recommendations in relation to:\n––\nBoard composition and succession planning for the Board;\n––\nremuneration levels and structure for KMP, and other members of the Executive Committee as appointed from time to time;\n––\nthe public reporting of remuneration for KMP, and other members of the Executive Committee;\n––\nthe performance assessment of the Executive Committee;\n––\ndesigning Company remuneration policy and regulations with regard to corporate governance; and\n––\ndiversity.\n3.\t Executive remuneration\nThe Executive remuneration structure below is an appropriate reflection of Yanzhou’s majority shareholding in the Company.\n3.1  Objective\nRemuneration frameworks for Executives are structured to be market competitive and to reflect the reward strategy of the organisation.

The STI opportunity is reviewed annually. A benchmarking\nexercise is completed against comparable peers in listed companies, and no changes were proposed for 2017. The CEO and CEC have\nan agreed STI opportunity of between a minimum of 0% and a maximum of 126% of FAR for 2017. The Board believes this level of STI\nopportunity is reasonable and competitive for the current environment.\n2.\t STI Scorecard – this consists of a number of Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”). For the Executives named in this report, all KPIs are\nmeasured at the Company level. The KPIs fall into the following categories TRIFR (Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate) (25% weighting),\nEnvironment (10% weighting), FOR (Free On Rail) Cash Costs (35% weighting), Profitability (20% weighting) and Specific Business Unit\nMeasures (10%). Details of how the STI Scorecard is evaluated are set out below. STI scorecard performance is assessed by the Chairman\nof the Executive Committee and the Chief Executive Officer, reviewed by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, and approved by\nthe Board.\n3.\t Individual Performance – this is measured by Key Result Areas (“KRA”). These KRAs are aligned to the Executive’s role and include areas\nsuch as special projects, achievement of operating and capital expenditure budgets, and achievement of growth/continuous improvement\ninitiatives. Based on performance against the KRAs, the Executive receives a performance rating at the end of the year on a scale from\nExceptional to Below Standard. In the case of the Chief Executive Officer, individual performance is assessed by the Nomination and\nRemuneration Committee, to be endorsed by the Board. For all other Executives, performance is assessed by the Chief Executive Officer and\nthe Chair of the Executive Committee.",

The Independent\nBoard Committee was constituted two times in 2017 for the purposes\nof considering transactions between or involving the Company and\nits major shareholder, Yanzhou. In each case, the Independent Board\nCommittee comprised at least three independent directors.\nOther committees may be established by the Board as and\nwhen required.\nMembership of the Board committees is based on the needs of\nthe Company, relevant regulatory requirements, and the skills and\nexperience of individual directors.\nDirector independence\nThe Board comprises 11 directors, of whom 5 hold their positions in\nan independent non-executive capacity (based on the independence\nstandard disclosed below). The Company’s current independent\ndirectors are Geoffrey Raby, Gregory Fletcher, David Moult\n(appointed 30 January 2018), Helen Gillies (appointed 30 January\n2018) and Xing Feng (appointed 15 December 2017). During their\nappointment, Messrs William Randall (resigned 9 November 2017)\nand Vincent O’Rourke AM (resigned 30 January 2018) and Huaqiao\nZhang (resigned 30 January 2018) were each deemed to be\nindependent directors.\nThe Board has assessed the independence of each of the Non-\nExecutive Directors (including the Chairman) in light of their interests\nand relationships. A majority of the Board are not considered\nindependent directors having regard to their affiliation with the\nCompany’s major shareholder, Yanzhou, and accordingly the\nCompany does not comply with Recommendation 2.4 of the ASX\nRecommendation. However, the Board considers that its composition\nappropriately represents the interests of its shareholders including\nits major shareholder, Yanzhou, and that the Board has put in place\nappropriate policies and procedures to guide the Board and senior\nexecutives in circumstances where conflicts of interest may arise and\nin its dealings with Yanzhou, including establishing the Independent\nBoard Committee referred to above.\nTo help ensure that any conflicts of interests are identified, the\nCompany has put in place a standing agenda item at all meetings\nof the Board and its committees to provide the directors with the\nopportunity of declaring any conflicts of interests in the subject matter\nof the proposed resolutions made within the meeting.\nTo assist the Board in making independent judgements, the Board\nCharter sets out the procedure by which the Board collectively, and\neach individual director, can seek independent professional advice,\nat the Company’s expense.\nEach independent director must regularly provide the Board with\nall information relevant to their continued compliance with the\nindependence standard. The independence of directors will be\nreviewed by the Board on a regular basis with assistance from the\nNomination and Remuneration Committee. The Nomination and\nRemuneration Committee will also assist the Board with regular\nevaluation of the performance of the Board, Board committees and\nindividual directors.\nIndependence Standard\nIn assessing the independence of its directors, the Board has regard\nto the factors relevant to assessing the independence of a director\nthat are set out in Box 2.3 of the ASX Recommendations (3rd edition).\nThe criteria considered in assessing the independence of Non-\nExecutive Directors are also set out in the Board Charter.\nA director is considered independent if the director:\n––\nis not, and has not within the last three years been, employed in an\nexecutive capacity by the Company or any of its child entities;\n––\nis not, nor has within the last three years been, a partner, director\nor senior employee of a provider of material professional services\nto the Company or any of its child entities;\n––\nis not, nor has within the last three years been, in a material\nbusiness relationship with the Company or any of its child entities,\nor an officer of, or otherwise associated with, someone with such\na relationship;\n––\nis not a substantial Shareholder of the Company or an officer\nof, or otherwise associated with, a substantial Shareholder of\nthe Company;\n––\ndoes not have a material contractual relationship with the\nCompany or any of its child entities other than as a director;\n––\ndoes not have close family ties with any person who falls within any\nof the categories described above;\n––\nhas not been a director of the Company for such a period that his\nor her independence may have been compromised; and\n––\nis free from any other interest, position, association or relationship\nthat might interfere, or might reasonably be seen to interfere, with\nthe director’s capacity to bring an independent judgement to bear\non issues before the Board and to act in the best interests of the\nCompany and its shareholders generally.\nThe Company’s Constitution provides that the Company’s\nshareholders holding a majority of the issued shares of the Company\n(which confer the right to vote) may nominate a director to the office\nof Chairman and may elect one or more directors to the office of\nVice Chair.\nAlthough as a nominee of Yanzhou, Xiyong Li, the Chairman is not\nconsidered independent by the independence standard (as above),\nthe Board considers that this is an appropriate reflection of Yanzhou’s\nmajority shareholding in the Company. While a majority of the directors\nare associated with Yanzhou this is considered appropriate in light of\nYanzhou’s major shareholding in the Company.\nXing Feng is employed by China Cinda Asset Management, an\nassociate of Cinda International HGB Investment (UK) Limited\n(a substantial shareholder of the Company). The Board considers that\nthis relationship does not materially interfere with, nor is perceived to\ninterfere with, the independent exercise of Mr Feng’s judgement and\nthat he is able to fulfil the role of independent director for the purpose\nof the ASX Recommendations. Accordingly, the Board considers\nMr Feng to be an independent Non-Executive Director. Where\nappropriate, Mr Feng will stand aside from decision making where\nconflicts of interest may arise, and does not participate in Independent\nBoard Committees.",

      "text_content": "CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (CONTINUED)\n74      YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\nOperating risks\nThe Company’s operations are subject to operating risks that\ncould result in decreased coal production which could reduce their\nrespective revenues. Operational difficulties may impact the amount\nof coal produced, delay coal deliveries or increase the cost of mining\nfor a varying length of time. These operating risks include (but are\nnot limited to) industrial, mine collapses, cave-ins or other failures\nrelating to mine infrastructure, including tailings dams, interruptions\ndue to inclement or hazardous weather conditions, power interruption,\ncritical equipment failure (in particular any protracted breakdown\nor issues with any of the Company’s CHPP or a major excavator),\nfires, and explosions from methane gas or coal dust, accidental\nmine water discharges, flooding and variations in or unusual or\nunexpected geological or geotechnical mining conditions (particularly\nin the Company’s underground operations). Such risks could result\nin damage to applicable mines, personal injury, environmental\ndamage, delays in coal production, decreased coal production, loss\nof revenue, monetary losses and possible legal liability. Although the\nCompany’s insurance policies provide coverage for some of these\nrisks, the amount and scope of insurance cover is limited by market\nand economic factors and there can be no assurance that these risks\nwould be fully covered by insurances maintained by the Company.\nInjury or accident risks\nIf any injuries or accidents occur in a mine, this could have adverse\nfinancial implications including legal claims for personal injury, wrongful\ndeath, amendments to approvals, potential production delays or\nstoppages, any of which may have a material adverse effect on the\nfinancial performance and/or financial position of the Company.\nFunding risks\nThe amount of future funding required by the Company will depend\non a number of factors, including the performance of the Company’s\nbusiness at that time. The Company’s business operations and\ncashflow are highly sensitive to any fluctuation in the US$ coal price,\ncoal production from its operations, demand for its coal product and\nUS$ movement in foreign exchange rates, particularly movements in\nthe A$:US$ exchange rate.\nIn developing its business plan and operating budget, the Company\nhas made certain assumptions regarding coal prices, the A$:US$\nexchange rate, future production levels and other factors which\ndetermine the Company’s financial performance.\nIf a funding shortfall materialises, the Company may need to raise\nsubstantial additional debt or equity. The Company’s capacity to\nsecure the requisite level of funding will depend on the amount\nof funding required, the performance and future prospects of its\nbusiness and a number of other factors, including US$ coal prices,\ninterest rates, economic conditions, debt market conditions, equity\nmarket conditions, and future levels of Yanzhou support.\nTo the extent that the Company is not able to secure additional\nfinancing (whether debt or equity) on acceptable terms from third\nparties, the Company will continue to rely on financial support\nfrom Yanzhou.\nAs at 31 December 2017, the Company had a loan receivable from\nWatagan of A$712 million (re-drawable up to A$1.36 billion) which\nis subject to impairment testing. There is a guarantee provided\nby Yankuang (being the ultimate parent entity of the Company) to\nindemnify the Company for any amounts due and payable under the\nloan which are not paid by Watagan.\nYanzhou’s and Yankuang’s capacity to meet their respective funding\ncommitments will depend on their financial position at the time and\ntheir capacity to raise the necessary funds to meet the commitments.\nYancoal’s capacity to source further funding from Yanzhou will depend\non Yanzhou’s willingness and financial capacity to provide that\nfunding. There can be no assurance that Yanzhou will be in a position\nto provide financial support to Yancoal or that Yankuang will be in a\nposition to meet its obligations under the guarantee in respect of the\nWatagan Agreements.\nAdverse foreign exchange rate movements\nForeign exchange risk is the risk of the Company sustaining loss\nthrough adverse movements in exchange rates.\nSuch losses can impact the Company’s financial position and\nperformance and the level of additional funding required to support\nthe Company’s businesses.\nThe liabilities, earnings and cash flows of the Company are influenced\nby movements in exchange rates, especially movements in the\nA$:US$ exchange rate.\nWhile the Company operates entirely in Australia and its costs\nare primarily denominated in its functional currency, the A$,\nforeign currency exposure arises particularly in relation to coal\nsupply contracts, which generally are priced and payable in US$,\nprocurement of imported plant and equipment, which can be priced in\nUS$ or other foreign currencies, and debt denominated in US$.\nThe impact of exchange rate movements will vary depending\non factors such as the nature, magnitude and duration of the\nmovements, the extent to which currency risk is hedged under\nforward exchange contracts or other hedging instruments and the\nterms of these contracts.\nThe hedging policy of the Company aims to protect against\nthe volatility of cash expenditures or reduced collection in the\nabovementioned transactions as well as to reduce the volatility of\nprofit or loss for retranslation of US dollar denominated loans at each\nperiod end.\nHedging through bank issued instruments\nOperating foreign exchange risk that arises from firm commitments\nor highly probable transactions is managed through the use of bank\nissued forward foreign currency contracts and collar option contracts.\nThe Company hedges a portion of contracted US dollar sales and\nasset purchases settled in foreign currencies in each currency to\nmitigate the adverse impact on cash flow due to the future rise or fall\nin Australian dollars against the relevant currencies.\nCoal prices and coal demand risk\nThe Company generates revenue from the sale of coal. In developing\nits business plan and operating budget, the Company makes certain\nassumptions regarding coal prices and demand for coal. The prices\nwhich the Company will receive for its coal depend on numerous\nmarket factors beyond its control and, accordingly, some underlying\ncoal price assumptions relied on by the Company may materially\nchange and actual coal prices and demand may differ materially from\nthose expected.\nThe prices for coal are determined predominantly by world markets,\nwhich are affected by numerous factors, including the outcome of\nfuture sale contract negotiations, general economic activity, industrial\nproduction levels, changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in\nenergy demand and demand for steel, changes in the supply of\nseaborne coal, technological changes, changes in production levels",

The Company’s\nsuccess or failure in improving productivity will become particularly\nimportant to the Company’s financial performance if the coal price\nremains at current levels or falls further.\nThe Company’s coal production can be impacted by a number\nof factors, including unforeseen geological or geotechnical issues\n(particularly in the Company’s underground operations), abnormal\nwet weather conditions (particularly in Queensland), unforeseen\ndelays or complexities in installing and operating mining longwall\nsystems, protracted breakdown of coal handling infrastructure and\nother mining equipment and rail and port breakdowns and outages.\nRegulatory factors and the occurrence of other operating risks can\nalso limit production.\nDebt Costs\nThe majority of the Company’s loans are US$ LIBOR based\nfloating rate loans and currently there are no interest rate hedging\narrangements in place. As a result, any increase in the US$ LIBOR\nfrom current levels will expose the Company to higher debt costs.\nTaxation Risks\nIn addition to the corporate income tax imposed on the Company,\nthe Company is required to pay government royalties, direct and\nindirect taxes and other imposts in the jurisdictions in which the\nCompany will operate. The Company may be affected by changes\nin government taxation and royalty policies or in the interpretation or\napplication of such policies under Australian laws.\nThe potential of the Company to obtain the benefit of existing\ntax losses and claim other tax attributes will depend on future\ncircumstances and may be affected by changes in ownership of\nboth Yanzhou and Yancoal, business activities, thin capitalisation\nthresholds, tax bases and any other conditions relating to the use\nof tax losses or other attributes of the group. The ability to use the\nCompany’s carried forward losses will depend on the Company’s\ncontinued satisfaction of the loss recoupment tests under Australian\ntax laws and be subject to the availability of sufficient future\ntaxable profits.\nAustralian Accounting Standards (AAS)\nAAS are issued by the AASB and are beyond the control of\nthe Company and the Directors. Any changes to AAS or to the\ninterpretation of those standards may have an adverse effect on the\nreported financial performance or financial position of the Company.\nIn particular, the accounting treatment for transactions such as\nthe transfer of the NSW mining assets of Ashton, Austar and\nDonaldson to Watagan could be reviewed by standard setters\nand may be subject to change. In the event that the Company is\nrequired to reconsolidate Watagan’s results and financial position\ninto its consolidated financial statements ahead of the scheduled\ndate in 2025, due to a change to AAS or their interpretation, the\nreconsolidation may have an adverse effect on the reported financial\nperformance or financial position of the Company.\nRegulatory approvals risks\nThe ability of the Company to meet its long term production target\nprofile depends on (amongst other things) the Company being able\nto obtain on a timely basis, and maintain, all necessary regulatory\napprovals (including any approvals arising under applicable mining\nlaws, environmental regulations and other laws) for its current\noperations and expansion and growth projects, including obtaining\nplanning approvals, land access, land owner consents and addressing\nany native title issues, impacts on the environment and objections\nfrom local communities.\nThe requirement to obtain approvals and to address potential and\nactual issues for existing and future mining projects is common to\nall companies in the coal sector. However, there is no assurance\nor guarantee that the Company will be in a position to secure any\nor all of the required consents, approvals and rights necessary to\nmaintain its current production profile from its existing operations or to\ndevelop its growth projects in a manner which will result in profitable\nmining operations and the achievement of its long term production\ntargets. If these approvals (or other approvals required for the planned\nproduction increases) are not obtained, or if conditional or limited\napprovals are obtained, the economic viability of the relevant projects\nmay be adversely affected, which may in turn result in the value of the\nrelevant assets being impaired.\nThe Company continues to engage openly and transparently with all\nState and federal Government and approval bodies, while operating\nto the highest safety, environmental and legislative standards to work\ntowards facilitating all approvals in a timely manner.\nEstimates of Resources and Reserves and geology\nThe volume and quality of the coal that the Company recovers may\nbe less than the Resource and Reserve estimates reported to date.\nResource and Reserve estimates are expressions of judgment based\non knowledge, experience and industry practice. There are risks\nassociated with such estimates, including that coal mined may be of\na different quality or grade, tonnage or strip ratio from those in the\nestimates and the ability to economically extract and process the coal\nmay not eventuate. Resource and Reserve estimates are necessarily\nimprecise and depend to some extent on interpretations and\ngeological assumptions, coal prices, cost assumptions, and statistical\ninferences which may ultimately prove to have been unreliable.",

Changes\nin the costs of mining and processing operations as well as capital\ncosts could occur, including as a result of unforeseen events, such\nas international and local economic and political events (including\nmovement in exchange rates) or unexpected geological or mining\nconditions, and could have material adverse financial consequences\nfor the Company.\nNICG and WICET debt\nAs a shipper in NCIG and WICET, the Company’s source mines are\nrequired to maintain a minimum level of Marketable Coal Reserves\n(11 years’ worth of contracted capacity). Non-compliance with\nthis requirement would ultimately result in the termination of the\nindividual contracts and require the Company to pay its share of any\noutstanding senior debt, currently approximately, A$1 billion and\nA$0.3 billion, respectively.\nMine closure\nClosure of any of the mines or other operations of the Company\nbefore the end of their mine life (e.g. due to environmental, geological,\ngeotechnical, commercial and/or health and safety issues), could\ntrigger significant employee redundancy costs, closure and\nrehabilitation expense and other costs or loss of revenues. Many\nof these costs will also be incurred where mines are closed at the\nend of their planned mine life or placed on care and maintenance. A\nmove to care and maintenance has the potential to trigger significant\nemployee redundancy costs and a subsequent loss of revenues, as a\nminimal employee presence is required for ongoing management and\nrehabilitation of the mine.\nIf one or more of the relevant sites are closed earlier than anticipated,\nthe Company will be required to fund the closure costs on an\nexpedited basis and potentially lose revenues, which could have an\nadverse financial effect. In addition, there is a risk that claims may be\nmade arising from environmental remediation upon closure of one or\nmore of their sites.\nCoal supply agreements\nThe Company’s coal supply agreements typically require the delivery\nof a fixed or minimum quantity of coal at a location, at a time and\nover a period stipulated in the agreement. To the extent that any\ncontracted volumes cannot be delivered as agreed, the Company\nmay be liable to pay substantial compensation for the resulting losses,\ncosts and charges (including demurrage) incurred by the buyer.\nAs customer contracts expire, the Company will be likely to renew\ncontracts with long-term customers, or seek to enter into new\ncontracts with new buyers and markets, depending on the feasibility\nof this. Tonnes that are not contracted are sold onto the spot market\nat either index-linked or fixed price levels. The Company’s strategy\nfor 2018 will be to increase its term contracted position as well as to\ntarget end-user customers as opposed to traders.\nMost of the Company’s coal supply agreements also require the\ndelivery of coal meeting specified quality thresholds for characteristics\nsuch as moisture content, sulphur content and ash content.\nDepending on these quality thresholds, coal will be sold into markets\nthat are the highest paying for coal with the relevant qualities.\nJoint ventures and reliance on third parties\nThe Company holds a number of joint venture interests, including\ninterests in the Middlemount, Moolarben, HVO, Mount Thorley and\nWarkworth joint ventures, PWCS, NCIG and WICET, with other\nparties. Decision making, management, marketing and other key\naspects of each joint venture are regulated by agreements between\nthe relevant joint venture participants. Under these agreements,\ncertain decisions require the endorsement of third party joint\nventure participants and the Company relies on the co-operation\nof these third parties for the success of its current operations and/\nor the development of its growth projects and the transportation of\nincreased production.\nThe Company cannot control the actions of third party joint venture\nparticipants, and therefore cannot guarantee that joint ventures will\nbe operated or managed in accordance with the preferred direction\nor strategy of the Company. There is a risk that the veto rights of,\nor consents required from, the joint venture partners will prevent the\nbusiness and assets of a joint venture from being developed, operated\nand managed in accordance with that preferred direction or strategy.",

      "text_content": "CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT    ANNUAL REPORT 2017      77\nThe Company also use contractors and other third parties for\nexploration, mining and other services generally, and is reliant on\na number of third parties for the success of its current operations\nand for the development of its growth projects. While this is normal\nfor the mining and exploration industry, problems caused by third\nparties may arise which may have an impact on the performance and\noperations of the Company. Any failure by counterparties to perform\ntheir obligations may have a material adverse effect on the Company\nand there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in\nattempting to enforce its contractual rights through legal action.\nCompetition\nThe coal industry is highly competitive, and an increase in production\nor reduction in prices of competing coal from both Australia and\noverseas may adversely impact the Company’s ability to sell its coal\nproducts and the price to be attained for sales. Increased competition\nin the future, including from new competitors, may emerge. This\ncompetition may relate not only to coal produced and sold, but\nalso to competition for the acquisition of new projects, which may\nadversely affect the ability of the Company to acquire new interests on\nacceptable terms should it wish to make such acquisitions.\nFurther industry consolidation could result in competitors improving\ntheir scale or productivity or competitors may develop lower-cost\ngeological coal resources or develop resources in lower cost base\ngeographies, increasing pressure on the Company’s ability to maintain\nits margins.\nThere is significant competition within the resources industry in\nAustralia, the United States and Asia. Furthermore, new entrants\nto the industry may emerge in one or more of those markets,\nincreasing the competitive pressure on the Company. This pressure\ncould adversely affect the Company’s market share and financial\nperformance and position.\nTitle risks\nExploring or mining for coal is generally illegal without a tenement\ngranted by the State Governments. The grant and renewal of\ntenements is subject to a regulatory regime and each tenement\nis subject to certain conditions. There is no certainty that an\napplication for grant or renewal of a tenement will be granted at all\nor on satisfactory terms or within expected timeframes. Further, the\nconditions attached to tenements may change. The permitting rules\nare complex and may change over time, making the title holder’s\nresponsibility to comply with the applicable requirements more\nonerous, more costly or even impossible, thereby precluding or\nimpairing continuing or future mining operations. There is a risk that\nthe Company may lose title to any of its granted titles if it is unable\nto comply with conditions or if the land subject to the title is required\nfor public purposes. There is also a risk that a tenement may not\nbe granted from any applications for renewals of tenements or for\nnew tenements.\nObtaining mining tenements often involves first obtaining consents\nfrom landholders and other third parties, some of which may in\ncertain circumstances have a right of veto, as well as approvals\n(such as environmental approvals). There is a risk that the requisite\nconsents and approvals may not be able to be obtained on time\nor on acceptable commercial terms, or may not be able to be\nobtained at all, and consequently have an adverse financial effect on\nthe Company.\nNative Title\nWhere the grant or renewal of a tenement is in respect of land in\nrelation to which native title may exist, the Company will need to\ncomply with the NTA in order for the tenement to be validly granted.\nCompliance with the NTA (and the relevant native title process to\nbe followed for the grant of the tenement e.g. the right to negotiate\nprocess) may be prolonged or delayed, and substantial compensation\nmay be payable as part of any agreement reached, including for\nthe extinguishment or impairment of the relevant native title rights\nand interests.\nThe existence or determination of native title may, therefore, affect the\nexisting or future activities of the Company and impact on its ability\nto develop projects which may in turn impact its operational and\nfinancial performance.\nOverlapping tenement risks\nSome of the Company’s mines and associated tenements adjoin or\nare overlapped by petroleum tenements and adjoin other exploration\ninterests held by third parties. Overlapping tenements could potentially\nprevent, delay or increase the cost of the future development of\nthe Company’s projects because the Company and the relevant\npetroleum exploration licence or other exploration licence holders\ncould potentially seek to undertake their respective activities on the\noverlapping area or the same resource seams and in some cases the\noverlapping petroleum tenure holder’s consent may be required.\nThere is no guarantee that agreement will be reached with the\noverlapping petroleum tenement holder or that agreement will not\nbe delayed or will be reached on terms satisfactory to the Company.\nThere is also a risk that if agreement cannot be reached with\noverlapping tenement holders the matter may be referred to the\nrelevant minister or a court who may make a decision which adversely\nimpacts upon or prevents the project proposed by the Company.\nEnforcement and counterparty insolvency risks\nThe Company has entered into contracts which are important to the\nfuture of its businesses including (but not limited to) for the provision of\ncoal handling services, long term sales contracts, debt facilities, long\nterm leases, contract mining and the provision of certain guarantees,\nindemnities and sureties.\nAny failure by counterparties to perform those contracts may\nhave a material adverse effect on the Company and there can be\nno assurance that it would be successful in enforcing any of its\ncontractual rights through legal action.\nIn addition, any insolvency of a counterparty to any of these contracts\nmay have a material adverse effect on the Company and there can\nbe no assurance that it would be successful in enforcing any of its\ncontractual rights through legal action or recovering all monies owned\nby that counterparty (including under any claim for damages).\nCoal royalties\nRoyalties are payable to the NSW and QLD state governments\non coal produced in NSW and QLD. In both states, the royalties\nare payable on an ad valorem basis as they are calculated as a\npercentage of the value for which the coal is sold. The relevant\nState Governments may increase these royalties or their method of\ncalculation. Any impost of new royalty related state tax or increase in\nroyalty rates may have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial\nposition and/or financial performance.",

This agreement was followed\nby the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, and the\nsigning of the Paris Agreement within the United Nationals Framework\nConvention on Climate Change. The Paris Agreement was signed\nby representatives from 195 countries, and aims to hold back the\nincrease in global temperatures, increase the ability of countries to\nadapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and provide channels\nto finance projects that lead to greenhouse gas reductions.\nIn recent years, China has also taken steps to address severe air\npollution in many Chinese cities by adopting a range of policies to\nlower carbon emissions and reduce coal usage.\nExtensive government regulations relating to climate change impose\ncosts on the mining operations of the Company, and future regulations\ncould increase those costs, limit the Company’s ability to produce and\nsell coal, or reduce demand for the Company’s coal products.\nTechnological change\nThermal coal as a source of energy competes with other forms of\nelectricity generation (such as hydro, solar and wind). In recent years,\nthe global shift from conventional fuels to renewable sources of energy\nhas created greater competition for thermal coal in the market.\nAs renewable technologies become more efficient and cost effective,\nthey may gain an economic advantage over coal-fired and other\nfossil fuel based electricity generation. These economic factors,\ncombined with increasing costs to comply with emission limits for\nother air pollutants, may result in the continued retirement of existing\ncoal-powered generation capacity, and the cancellation of planned\nadditional coal-fired power capacity, which may reduce demand for\nthermal coal in the market.\nKey personnel\nA number of key personnel are important to attaining the business\ngoals of the Company. One or more of these key employees could\nleave their employment or cease to actively participate in the\nmanagement of the Company and this may adversely affect the ability\nof the Company to conduct its business and, accordingly, affect its\nfinancial performance and its share price. There may be a limited\nnumber of persons with the requisite experience and skills to serve in\nthe Company’s senior management positions if existing management\nleave the Company. If the Company cannot attract, train and retain\nqualified managers, and other personnel, the Company may be\nunable to successfully manage its growth or otherwise compete\neffectively in the Australian coal industry.\nEnvironmental activism\nEnvironmental lobby groups in both QLD and NSW have recently\nmade submissions opposing both operation and expansion of coal\nmines in an attempt to prevent new mine developments or expansion\nof existing mines on the basis of environmental concerns. Increased\ncommunity concern and adverse actions taken by community and\nenvironmental groups may delay or prevent the Company from\nprogressing new mine developments or development or expansion\nof existing mines, or may mean that those mines are subject to\nconditions that adversely affect their profitability and consequently the\nfinancial performance of the Company.\nChanges in government policy, regulation or legislation\nThe resources industry is subject to extensive legislation,\nregulations and supervision by a number of federal and state\nregulatory organisations.\nAny future legislation and regulatory change may affect the\nresources industry and may adversely affect the Company’s financial\nperformance and position, such as future laws that may limit the\nemission of greenhouse gases or the use of coal in power generation.\nEnvironment and planning\nIn recent years, state government policies of NSW and QLD have\nbeen introduced in the interests of protecting agricultural and urban\nland from the effects of mining. These include the QLD Government’s\nCentral Queensland Plan and Regional Planning Interests Act and\nthe NSW Government’s Strategic Regional Land Use Policy, Aquifer\nInterference Policy, and 2013 amendments to the State Environmental\nPlanning Policy (Mining, Petroleum Production and Extractive\nIndustries) 2007. Each of these policies is relevant to the areas in\nwhich the Company has mining operations. Accordingly, there is no\nassurance that the future development and exploration activities of\nthe Company will result in profitable or commercially viable mining\noperations in these areas.\nIn 2013, the NSW State Government introduced the fit and proper\nperson consideration in making decisions about mining rights\nincluding the grant, transfer, renewal, cancellation and suspension\nof such rights. This allows the Government to consider a miner’s\nconduct (in particular its compliance with environmental and mining\nlegislation), as well as a miner’s financial capabilities and technical\nexpertise. In recent years, the NSW State Government has also\nsignificantly increased the maximum penalties for breaches of mining\nand environmental legislation, and the resources of regulators to\ninvestigate possible breaches and prosecute mining companies.\nThese changes have resulted in the updating of compliance\nprograms, and increased the risk of prosecution for breaches of\nrelevant legislation.\nIn 2013, the QLD State Government reviewed the method of\ncalculating the financial assurance required to be provided by mining\ncompanies in respect of their rehabilitation liability and this review\nled to a significant increase in financial assurance amounts that are\nrequired to be covered by bank guarantees. The Audit Office of\nNSW has carried out a review of rehabilitation liabilities in respect of\nmines and the review has led to an increase in the amount of security\nrequired in respect of rehabilitation liabilities.",

The Company could become exposed to claims or\nlitigation by persons alleging they are owed fees or other contractual\nentitlements, employees, regulators, competitors or other third parties.\nInsurance\nThe Company has insurance coverage for certain operating risks.\nHowever, it may become subject to liability (including in relation to\npollution, occupational illnesses or other hazards), or suffer loss\nresulting from business interruption, for which it is not insured (or has\nnot sufficiently insured) or cannot insure, including liabilities in respect\nof past activities.\nShould a major uninsured loss be suffered, future financial\nperformance could be materially adversely affected. In addition,\ninsurance may not continue to be available at economically\nacceptable premiums. As a result, the insurance coverage may\nnot cover the full scope and extent of claims against the Company\nor losses it may incur, including, but not limited to, claims for\nenvironmental or industrial accidents, occupational illnesses, pollution\nand product liability, war, terrorism and business interruption.\nTo the extent a successful claim against the Company proceeds, it\nmay have a material adverse effect on its financial position.\nExploration and development risks\nThere are several risks relating to coal mining exploration and\ndevelopment which are common to the industry and which, if realised,\nhave the capacity to affect operations, production, cash flow and\nfinancial performance of the Company.\nDevelopment and exploration activities may be affected by factors\nbeyond the control of the Company, including geological conditions,\nseismic activity, mineralisation, consistency and predictability of coal\ngrades, changes to law, changes to the regulatory framework applying\nto mining, overlapping resources tenure, and the rights of indigenous\npeople on whose land exploration activities are undertaken.\nAny discovery of a coal deposit does not guarantee that the mining\nof that deposit would be commercially viable, with the size of the\ndeposit, development and operating costs, land ownership, coal\nprices and recovery rates all being key factors in determining\ncommercial viability.\nIssues that arise during development, construction and mine start-\nup may result in increased costs, delayed commencement of coal\nproduction, delayed receipt of coal revenue or coal production not\ncommencing at all. These problems may include delays in obtaining\napprovals (including land use approvals) or in the construction of mine\ninfrastructure. There are many milestones which need to be met in a\ntimely fashion for production to commence on any projects currently\nin the pre-development or development stages.\nThe Company may also be exposed to risks including risks of default\nassociated with managing contractual relationships with participants\nin any of the development or exploration joint ventures or other\ncontractual relationships to which it is, or may become, a party.\nTransport and infrastructure\nCoal produced from the Company’s mining operations is transported\nto customers by a combination of road, rail and sea.\nA number of factors could disrupt or restrict access to essential coal\ntransportation and handling services, including (but not limited to):\n––\nweather related problems;\n––\nkey equipment and infrastructure failures;\n––\nrail or port capacity constraints;\n––\ncongestions and inter-system losses;\n––\nindustrial action;\n––\nfailure to obtain consents from third parties for access to rail\nor land;\n––\nfailure or delay in the construction of new rail or port capacity;\n––\nfailure to meet contractual requirements;\n––\naccess is removed or not granted by regulatory authority;\n––\nbreach of regulatory framework;\n––\nmismatch of below rail capacity, above rail capacity and port\ncapacity; and\n––\npossible sale of infrastructure,\nall or any of which could impair the Company’s ability to supply coal\nto customers and/or increase costs, and consequently may have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company’s financial position.\nSignificant increases in transport costs (such as emissions control\nrequirements and fluctuations in the price of diesel fuel and\ndemurrage) could make the Company’s coal less competitive when\ncompared to other fuels or coal produced from other regions.\nEnvironmental risks\nDue to the nature of coal mining processes, and the associated\nby-products, residues and tailings generated from these processes,\nall operations of the Company are subject to stringent environmental\nlaws and regulations.\nThere is a risk that past, present or future operations have not met\nor will not meet environmental or related regulatory requirements\nand/or that the approvals or modifications the Company is currently\nseeking, or may need to seek in the future, will not be granted. If\nthe Company is unsuccessful in these efforts or otherwise breaches\nthese environmental requirements, it may incur fines or penalties, be\nrequired to curtail or cease operations and/or be subject to increased\ncompliance costs or costs for rehabilitation or rectification works,\nwhich have not been previously planned at one or more of its sites.\nEnvironmental legislation may change in a manner that may require\ncompliance with additional standards, and a heightened degree of\nresponsibility for companies and their directors and employees. There\nmay also be unforeseen environmental liabilities resulting from coal\nrelated activities, which may be costly to remedy. In particular, the\nacceptable level of pollution and the potential abandonment costs\nand obligations for which the Company may become liable as a\nresult of its activities may be impossible to assess under the current\nlegal framework.",

Yancoal Australia Ltd is a for-profit\nentity for the purpose of preparing the financial statements.\nThe financial statements were authorised for issue in accordance with\na resolution of the Directors on 28 February 2018.\n(i) Compliance with IFRS\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group also comply with\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the\nInternational Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”).\n(ii) Subsidiaries\nThe Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has\nrights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has\nthe ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.\nSubsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is\ntransferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date that\ncontrol ceases.\nThe acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business\ncombinations by the Group. Intercompany transactions, balances\nand unrealised gains on transactions between the Group companies\nare eliminated.\nUnrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides\nevidence of the impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting\npolicies of subsidiaries are aligned to ensure consistency with the\npolicies adopted by the Group.\n(iii) Significant accounting policies\nSignificant accounting policies have been included in the\nrelevant notes to which the policies relate, and other significant\naccounting policies are discussed in Note F5. These policies\nhave been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless\notherwise stated.\n(iv) Historical cost convention\nThese financial statements have been prepared on an accrual\nbasis and under the historical cost convention, as modified by the\nrevaluation of available for sale financial assets and financial assets\nand liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through\nprofit or loss.\n(v) Rounding of amounts\nThe Company is of a kind referred to in ASIC Legislative Instrument\n2016/191, issued by the Australian Securities and Investments\nCommission, relating to the ‘rounding off’ of amounts in the financial\nstatements. Amounts in the financial statements have been rounded\noff in accordance with that legislative instrument to the nearest million\ndollars, or in certain cases, the nearest dollar.\n(vi) New and amended standards adopted by the Group\nThe Group has not elected to apply any other pronouncements\nbefore their operative date in the annual reporting period beginning\n1 January 2017.\nThe new standards that are applicable to for the first time for the year\nended 31 December 2017 are:\n––\nAASB 2016-1 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards –\nRecognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses\n––\nAASB 2016-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards –\nDisclosure Initiative: Amendments to AASB 107\nThese standards have introduced new disclosures for the Annual\nFinancial Report but did not affect the Group’s accounting policies or\nany of the amounts recognised in the financial statements.\n(vii) Impact of standards issued but not yet applied by the Group\nAustralian Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued but not\nyet applicable for the year ended 31 December 2017 that not been\napplied by the Group are disclosed in Note F7.\n(viii) Early adoption of standards\nCertain new accounting standards and interpretations have been\npublished that are not mandatory for 31 December 2017 reporting\nperiods and have not been early adopted by the Group. The Group’s\nassessment of the impact of these new standards and interpretations\nis set out below.\n(ix) Critical accounting estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the use of certain\ncritical accounting estimates that involve a higher degree of judgement\nor complexity. It also requires management to exercise its judgement\nin the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies.\nThe Directors evaluate estimates and judgements incorporated\ninto these financial statements based on historical knowledge and\nbest available current information. Estimates assume a reasonable\nexpectation of future events and are based on current trends and\neconomic data, obtained both externally and within the Company.\nThe resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the\nrelated actual results.\nDetails of critical accounting estimates and judgements can be found\nin the notes to which they relate and include income taxes B6, mining\ntenements C2, impairment of assets C3, exploration and evaluation\nassets C4, trade and other receivables C7, royalty receivable C9,\nprovisions C10, acquisition of Coal & Allied E1, and control of\nWatagan E2.",

Amounts disclosed as revenue are net of returns, trade\nallowances, rebates and amounts collected on behalf of third parties.\nThe Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured and it is probable that future economic benefits will\nflow to the entity. Revenue is recognised in the profit or loss as follows:\n(i) Sale of coal\nRevenue from the sale of coal is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and\ncan be measured reliably. Risks and rewards are considered passed to the buyer at the time of delivery, usually on a Free On Board (“FOB”)\nbasis. On occasion the sale of coal is recognised as the ship pulls into harbour on a Free Alongside Ship (“FAS”) basis or from the stockpile\non an ex-works basis.\n(ii) Interest\nInterest income from a financial asset is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate\napplicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that\nasset’s net carrying amount. Interest income from a finance lease is recognised over the term of the lease based on a pattern reflecting a\nconstant periodic rate of return on the net investment in the lease.\n(iii) Services\nRevenue from the rendering of a service is recognised upon the delivery of the service to the customer.\n(iv) Other\nOther primarily consists of dividends, rents, sub-lease rental and management fees. Dividends are recognised as revenue when the right\nto receive payment is established. Rental income arising on land surrounding a mine site is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the\nlease term. Contingent rental income is recognised as income in the periods in which it is earned.\n31 December\n2017\n$M\n31 December\n2016\n$M\nFrom continuing operations\nSales revenue\nSale of coal\n2,635\n1,203\nFair value losses recycled from hedge reserve\n(229)\n(133)\n2,406\n1,070\nOther revenue\nInterest income\n114\n125\nMining services fees\n52\n38\nOther\n29\n5\n195\n168\n2,601\n1,238",

Employee benefits recognised in the profit or loss are net of recoveries.\n(ii) Superannuation\nContributions made by the Group to defined contribution superannuation funds are recognised as an expense in the period in which they\nare incurred.\n(iii) Wages and salaries, annual leave and sick leave\nLiabilities for employee benefits for wages, salaries, annual leave and accumulating sick leave that are expected to be wholly settled within\n12 months of the reporting date represent present obligations resulting from employees’ services provided to the reporting date and are\ncalculated at undiscounted amounts based on wage and salary rates that the Group expects to pay as at the reporting date including\nrelated on costs, such as superannuation, workers compensation, insurance and payroll tax and are included in trade and other payables.\nNon-accumulating, non-monetary benefits such as housing and cars are expensed by the Group as the benefits are used by the employee.\nEmployee benefits payable later than 12 months have been measured at the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be\nmade for those benefits. In determining the liability, consideration is given to employee salary and wage increases and the probability that\nthe employee may satisfy any vesting requirements. Those cash flows are discounted using corporate bonds with terms to maturity that\nmatch the expected timing of cash flows attributable to employee benefits.\nAdditional Long Service Leave payments are made monthly to the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Corporation based\non the eligible monthly payroll of employees involved in the mining of black coal. Reimbursement is sought from the fund when long service\nleave is paid to employees involved in the mining of black coal. An asset for the amount recoverable from the Coal Mining Industry (Long\nService Leave Funding) Corporation is recognised in trade and other receivables.\nThese employee benefits are presented as current provisions as the Group has no unconditional right to deferred settlement for at least\n12 months after the end of the reporting period.",

However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for if it\narises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction\naffects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or\nsubstantially enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or\nthe deferred income tax liability is settled.\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable\namounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses. The carrying value of the deferred tax asset is reviewed at each\nreporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that future taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the\nasset to be recovered.\nDeferred tax liabilities and assets are recognised for taxable temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax bases of\ninvestments in controlled entities, except where the parent entity is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and\nit is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when the\ndeferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally\nenforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\nCurrent and deferred tax is recognised in the profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive\nincome or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.\nTax consolidation legislation\nYancoal Australia Ltd and its wholly owned Australian controlled entities have implemented the tax consolidation legislation for income tax\npurposes. The accounting policy in relation to this legislation is set out in Note E4.\nCritical accounting estimates and judgements\nThe Group is subject to income taxes in Australia. Significant judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes.\nDeferred tax assets, including those arising from unutilised tax losses, require the Group to assess the likelihood that the Group will generate\nsufficient taxable earnings in future periods, in order to utilise recognised deferred tax assets. Judgement is also required in respect of\nthe application of existing tax laws. Assumptions about the generation of future taxable profits depend on management’s estimates of\nfuture cash flows. These estimates of future taxable income are based on forecast cash flows from operations (which are impacted by\nproduction and sales volumes, coal prices, reserves, operating costs, closure and rehabilitation costs, capital expenditure, and other capital\nmanagement transactions). To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the\nGroup to realise the net deferred tax assets recorded at the reporting date could be impacted. In addition, future changes in tax laws could\nlimit the ability of the Group to obtain tax deductions in future periods.",

These capitalised costs are amortised over\nthe life of the mine if the roads service the entire mine or over the\nlife of the panels accessible from those mains if shorter than the\nmine life.\nA regular review is undertaken of each area of interest to\ndetermine the appropriateness of continuing to carry forward\nmine development costs in relation to that area of interest.\nAccumulated costs in relation to an abandoned area are written\noff in full in the period in which the decision to abandon the area\nis made.\nOpen cut\nDuring the commercial production stage of open pit operations,\nproduction stripping costs comprises the accumulation of\nexpenses incurred to enable access to the coal seam, and\nincludes direct removal costs (inclusive of an allocation of\noverhead expenditure) and machinery and plant running costs.\nProduction stripping costs are capitalised as part of an asset, if\nit can be demonstrated that it is probable that future economic\nbenefits will be realised, the costs can be reliably measured and\nthe entity can identify the component of the ore body for which\naccess has been improved. The asset is called “stripping activity\nasset” included in mine development.\nThe stripping activity asset is amortised on a systematic basis,\nover the expected useful life of the identified component of\nthe ore body that becomes more accessible as a result of the\nstripping activity. The units of production method shall be applied.\nProduction stripping costs that do not satisfy the asset\nrecognition criteria are expensed.\nDepreciation and amortisation\nThe depreciable amount of all fixed assets, excluding freehold\nland, is depreciated on a straight-line or units of production basis\nover the asset’s useful life to the Group based on life of mine\nplans and Joint Ore Reserves Committee “JORC” estimated\nreserves, commencing from the time the asset is held ready for\nuse. Leased assets are depreciated over the asset’s useful life\nor over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term\nif there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain\nownership at the end of the lease term. Leasehold improvements\nare depreciated over the period of the lease or estimated useful\nlife, whichever is the shorter, using the straight-line method.\nFor some assets, the useful life of the asset is linked to the level\nof production. In such cases, depreciation is charged on a units\nof production basis based on the recoverable reserves or the\nremaining useful hours. Alternatively, the straight-line method\nmay be used where this provides a suitable alternative because\nproduction is not expected to fluctuate significantly from one year\nto another.\nThe estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation\nmethod are reviewed at the end of each annual reporting\nperiod and any change in estimate is taken into account in the\ndetermination of remaining depreciation charges.\nThe estimated useful lives are as follows:\n––\nBuildings 10 – 25 years\n––\nMine development 10 – 40 years\n––\nPlant and equipment 2.5 – 40 years\n––\nLeased plant and equipment 2 – 20 years\nAn asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its\nrecoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than\nits estimated recoverable amount.\nAny gain or loss arising on the disposal of an item of property,\nplant and equipment is determined as the difference between\nthe sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is\nrecognised in profit or loss.\nSee Note C3 for further details on impairment of assets.\nC – OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES",

Mining\ntenements are amortised from the date when commercial production commences, or the date of acquisition. Amortisation is calculated over\nthe life of the mine on a ‘units of production’ method based on the Joint Ore Reserves Committee (“JORC”) estimated reserves.\nChanges in the annual amortisation rate resulting from changes in the remaining estimated reserves, are applied on a prospective basis from\nthe commencement of the next financial year. Every year the mining tenement’s carrying amount is compared to its recoverable amount and\nassessed for impairment, or for possible reversals of prior year impairment.\nSee Note C3 for further details on the impairment of assets.\n31 December\n2017\n$M\n31 December\n2016\n$M\nOpening net book amount\n2,128\n2,085\nAcquisition through business combination\n2,456\n–\nTransfers from exploration and evaluation assets\n26\n101\nImpairment reversal (refer Note C3(b))\n100\n–\nAmortisation\n(103)\n(58)\nTransfer to assets classified as held for sale\n(311)\n–\nClosing net book amount\n4,296\n2,128\nCritical accounting estimates and judgements\nCoal reserves and resources\nThe Group estimates its coal resources and reserves based on information compiled by Competent Persons as defined by the Australasian\nCode for Reporting Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (December 2012), which is prepared by the Joint Ore\nReserves Committee (“JORC”) of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Australian Institute of Geoscientists and Minerals\nCouncil of Australia, known as the JORC 2012 Code, and Australian Security Exchange (“ASX”) Listing Rules 2012.\nMineral Resources and Ore Reserves are based on geological information and technical data relating to the size, depth, quality of coal,\nsuitable production techniques and recovery rates. Such an analysis requires complex geological judgements to interpret the data. The\nestimation of Recoverable Reserves is based on factors such as estimates of foreign exchange rates, coal price, future capital requirements,\nrehabilitation obligations and production costs, along with geological assumptions and judgements made in estimating the size and quality\nof the reserves. Management forms a view of forecast sales prices based on current and long-term historical average price trend.\nAs the economic assumptions used may change and as additional geological information is produced during the operations of a mine,\nestimates of reserves may change. Additionally the amount of reserves that may actually be mined in the future and the Group’s current\nreserve estimate may vary. Such changes may impact the Group’s reported financial position and results including:\n––\nthe carrying value of the exploration and evaluation assets, mine properties, property, plant and equipment and goodwill may be affected\ndue to changes in estimated future cash flows;\n––\ndepreciation and amortisation charges in the statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income may change where such\ncharges are determined using the units of production method, or where the useful life of the related assets change; and\n––\nthe carrying value of deferred income tax assets may change due to changes in the judgements regarding the existence of such assets\nand in estimates of the likely recovery of such assets.",

The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. Mining tenements and other\nnon-financial assets (excluding goodwill) that have previously suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at\nthe end of each reporting period.\nFor the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped into Cash-Generating Units (“CGU”), being the lowest levels for which there\nare separately identifiable cash inflows which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. For the\npurposes of goodwill impairment testing, CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment\nis tested reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. The goodwill acquired in a business\ncombination, for the purpose of impairment testing, is allocated to CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.\nThe Group assesses impairment by evaluation of conditions and events specific to the Company that may be indicative of\nimpairment triggers.\n(ii) Other financial assets\nThe Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial\nassets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective\nevidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that\nloss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be\nreliably estimated.\nIf there is evidence of impairment for any of the Group’s financial assets carried at amortised cost, the loss is measured as the difference\nbetween the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, excluding future credit losses that have not been\nincurred. The cash flows are discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The loss is recognised in profit or loss.\nCritical accounting estimates and judgements\nThe determination of fair value and value in use requires management to make estimates and assumptions about expected production\nand sales volumes, coal prices (considering current and historical prices, price trends and related factors), foreign exchange rates, coal\nresources and reserves (refer to C2), operating costs, closure and rehabilitation costs and future capital expenditure. These estimates and\nassumptions are subject to risk and uncertainty; hence there is a possibility that changes in circumstances will alter these projections, which\nmay impact the recoverable amount of the assets. In such circumstances, some or all of the carrying amount of the assets may be further\nimpaired or the impairment charge reduced with the impact recorded in the statement of profit or loss.\n(a) CGU assessment\nThe Group operates on a regional basis within NSW and as such the NSW mines are considered to be one CGU. In 2017, Hunter Valley\nOperations and Mount Thorley Warkworth have been included in the NSW regional CGU alongside Moolarben and Stratford/Duralie. Yarrabee\nand Middlemount are considered separate CGUs due to location and ownership structure.\n(b) Assessment of fair value\nEach CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal has been determined using a discounted cash flow model over the expected life on mine (10 – 43\nyears). The fair value model adopted has been categorised as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\nC – OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES",

The year-\nend AUD/USD exchange rate was $0.78 per the Reserve Bank of Australia.\nProduction and capital costs\nProduction and capital costs are based on the Group’s estimate of forecast geological conditions, stage of\nexisting plant and equipment and future production levels.\nThis information is obtained from internally maintained budgets, the five year business plan, life of mine models,\nlife of mine plans, JORC reports, and project evaluations performed by the Group in its ordinary course\nof business.\nCoal reserves and resources\nSee discussion at Note C2 Mining tenements for how the coal reserves and resources are determined.\nDiscount rate\nThe Group has applied a post-tax discount rate of 10.5% (2016: 10.5%) to discount the forecast future\nattributable post-tax cash flows.\nThe post-tax discount rate applied to the future cash flow forecasts represents an estimate of the rate the\nmarket would apply having regard to the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the\nfuture cash flow estimates have not been adjusted.\nThis rate is also consistent with the Group’s five year business plan, life of mine models and project evaluations\nperformed in ordinary course of business.\nBased on the above assumptions at 31 December 2017 the recoverable amount is determined to be above book value for all CGUs resulting in\nno further impairment.\nAt 31 December 2017, the remaining impairment provision at Moolarben of $100 million has been reversed. Management have assessed the\nfollowing as being reasons for the reversal:\n––\nboth the NSW CGU and Moolarben standalone recoverable amounts are above book value;\n––\ncompletion of open-cut expansions and commencement of underground mining operations during 2017 have derisked future cash flows and\nincreased production from 8Mt in 2014 to approximately 17Mt of ROM coal; and\n––\ncurrent and life of mine operating costs and capital expenditure have decreased.\nThe impairment reversal has been recognised through the profit and loss.\nImpairment provision recorded as at 31 December 2017 is $73 million for Stratford and Duralie. Stratford and Duralie is included in the NSW\nregion CGU. Management may consider reversals of the impairment provision previously recognised if there is either an increase in the average\nlong term real revenue over the life of the mine due to either an increase in USD coal prices, or a further weakening of the AUD/USD foreign\nexchange rate or a combination of both, or further reductions in the current and life of mine operating costs, capital expenditure requirements, or\nan increase in the reserves.\nIn determining the value assigned to each key assumption, management has used: external sources of information; the expertise of external\nconsultants; as well as the experience of experts within the Group to validate entity specific assumptions such as coal reserves and resources.\nAdditionally various sensitivities have been determined and considered with respect to each of the key assumptions, further supporting the\nabove fair value conclusions.\n(c) Key sensitivity\nThe most sensitive input in the fair value model is forecast revenue, which is primarily dependent on estimated future coal prices and the AUD/\nUSD forecast exchange rate.\nIf coal prices were -10% LOM the recoverable amount would exceed book value for all CGUs with the exception of Yarrabee who exceeded the\nrecoverable amount by $15 million. If the AUD/USD long term forecast exchange rate was $0.80 the recoverable amount would exceed book\nvalue for all CGUs.\nGoodwill\nThe Yarrabee goodwill was not subject to an impairment charge as the recoverable amount is greater than the carrying value for this CGU.",

Rehabilitation of these areas is ongoing and in some cases will continue until 2060. The\nprovision for rehabilitation costs has been calculation based on the present value of the future costs expected to be\nincurred in restoring affected mining areas, assuming current technologies.\nKey estimate and judgement:\nThe rehabilitation provision has been created based on management’s internal estimates and assumptions relating\nto the current economic environment, which management believes is a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the\nfuture liability.\nThese estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions, however actual\nrehabilitation costs will ultimately depend upon the future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works and\nthe timing of when the rehabilitation costs are incurred. Timing is dependent upon when the mines ceases to produce at\neconomically viable rates, which in turn, will depend upon future coal prices, which are inherently uncertain.\nTake or pay\nIn acquiring part of a business or operation, an assessment is made on the fair value of the assets and liabilities under\nAASB 3 Business Combinations. Take or pay is the assessment of forecast excess capacity for port and rail contracts.\nA provision was recognised for the discounted estimated excess capacity. The provision has a finite life and will be\nreleased to profit or loss over the period in which excess capacity is realised.\nKey estimate and judgement:\nThe provision is recognised and estimated based on management’s assessment of contracted port capacity versus\nforecast usage. This involves making assumptions about the probability, amount and timing of an outflow of resources\nembodying economic benefits.\nSales contract\nIn acquiring part of a business or operation, an assessment is made on the fair value of the assets and liabilities under\nAASB 3 Business Combinations. The sales contract provision is the assessment of a coal supply and transportation\nagreement to supply coal to BLCP Power Limited in Thailand at below market prices. A provision was recognised for the\ndiscounted estimated variance between contract and market prices. The provision has a finite life and will be released to\nprofit or loss over the contract term.\nKey estimate and judgement:\nThe provision is recognised and estimated based on management’s assessment of future market prices.\nOther provisions\nThe provision includes marketing services fee payable to Noble Group Limited deemed above market norms, contingent\nroyalties payable to Rio Tinto Plc assessed as part of the Coal & Allied acquisition in 2017 which will be amortised over\nthe contract term, and make good provisions to cover the cost to ‘make good’ any hired equipment, in case any major\noverhaul costs are incurred at the end of the lease period.",

This condition is regarded as met only when the asset (or disposal group) is\navailable for immediate sale or disposal in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales or disposals of\nsuch assets (or disposal group) and the transaction is highly probable. Management must be committed to the transaction, which should be\nexpected to qualify for recognition as a completed transaction within one year from the date of classification.\nWhen the Group is committed to a sale plan or other transaction involving loss of control of a subsidiary, all of the assets and liabilities of\nthat subsidiary are classified as held for sale when the criteria described above are met, regardless of whether the Group will retain a non-\ncontrolling interest in its former subsidiary after the sale.\nNon-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their previous carrying amount and fair\nvalue less costs to sell.\n31 December\n2017\n$M\n31 December\n2016\n$M\nCurrent assets\nInvestment in associate (i)\n25\n–\nInterest in joint ventures (ii)\n531\n–\nLand held for sale (iii)\n57\nTotal current assets\n613\n–\nCurrent liabilities\nInterest in joint ventures (ii)\n67\n–\nTotal current liabilities\n67\n–\n(i) Investment in associate\nThe investment in associate was included in the asset sale agreement with Glencore as disclosed further in Note E1.

The purchase price was\nfunded by way of a $1,363 million loan from Yancoal Australia Ltd to Watagan bearing interest of BBSY plus 7.06% with a maturity date of\n1 April 2025. The outstanding interest and principal of this loan is guaranteed by Yankuang Group Co. Ltd, the Group’s ultimate parent entity.\nWatagan can make prepayments of the outstanding loan balance with any such prepayment capable of redraw in the future.\nD2 INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES\nAccounting Policies\n(i) Interest bearing liabilities\nInterest-bearing liabilities (excluding financial guarantees) are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs. They are subsequently\nmeasured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. US dollar interest bearing loans are designated as a hedge instrument\nin a cash flow hedge (refer to note D6).\n(ii) Leases\nProperty, plant and equipment held by the Group under leases that transfer to the Group substantially all of the risks and rewards of\nownership are classified as finance leases.\nThe leased property, plant and equipment are initially measured at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present\nvalue of the minimum lease payments. Subsequently they are accounted for in accordance with the property, plant and equipment\naccounting policy.\nThe corresponding minimum lease payments are included in lease liabilities within interest bearing liabilities. Each lease payment is allocated\nbetween finance cost and a reduction in the outstanding lease liability. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so\nas to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.\nThe net gains arising on the sale of an asset and the leasing back of the same asset using a finance lease are included as deferred income\nin the balance sheet and are released to the profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n(iii) Borrowing costs\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of assets that necessarily take a substantial period of\ntime to prepare for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for\ntheir intended use or sale.\nAll other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.\nD – CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING",

Glencore will also pay to Yancoal 27.9% of the\nUS$240 million in future non-contingent royalty payments and 49% of\nthe coal price linked contingent royalty payments associated with HVO\nthat are payable by Yancoal to Rio Tinto Limited for the Acquisition.\nThe Transaction is subject to a number of conditions precedent,\nincluding Glencore obtaining all necessary regulatory approvals,\nincluding final competition clearance from Japan. Should the\nconditions precedent not be satisfied then Yancoal would need to pay\nHVOR US$710 million to acquire its 32.4% interest in HVO.\n(v) Other contingencies\nA number of claims have been made against the Group, including in\nrespect of personal injuries, and in relation to contracts which Group\nmembers are party to as part of the Group’s day to day operations.\nThe personal injury claims which have been made against the Group\nhave largely been assumed by the insurers of the Group under the\nGroup’s insurance policies. The Directors do not believe that the\noutcome of these claims will have a material impact on the Group’s\nfinancial position.\nD8 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\nThe Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market\nrisk (including foreign exchange risk, price risk and interest rate risk),\ncredit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management\nprogram focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets\nand seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial\nperformance of the Group. The Group uses derivative financial\ninstruments such as foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain risk\nexposures. Derivatives are exclusively used for hedging purposes and\nnot as speculative instruments. The Group uses different methods to\nmeasure different types of risk to which it is exposed. These methods\ninclude sensitivity analysis in the case of foreign exchange, interest\nrate risk and other price risks, and aging analysis for credit risk.\nThe Group holds the following financial instruments:\n(i)\t Cash and cash equivalents;\n(ii)\t Trade and other receivables;\n(iii)\t Trade and other payables;\n(iv)\t Interest-bearing liabilities, including bank loans and finance leases;\n(v)\t Available-for-sale investments;\n(vi)\t Royalty receivable;\n(vii)\tDerivative financial instruments; and\n(viii)\tInterest-bearing loan from associate.\nThe Board of Directors has overall responsibility for determining risk\nmanagement objectives and policies and risk management is carried\nout by the Group Audit and Risk Management department along with\nthe Group Treasury department. The Board provides written principles\nfor overall risk management, as well as policies covering specific areas\nsuch as the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate foreign\nexchange risk. These derivative instruments create an obligation or\nright that effectively transfers one or more of the risks associated with\nan underlying financial instrument, asset or obligation.\nThe overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce\nrisk and volatility in financial performance without unduly affecting\ncompetitiveness and flexibility. Further details regarding these policies\nare set out below.\n(a) Market risk\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as\nforeign exchange rates, interest rates, securities prices, and coal\nprices, will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of\nfinancial instruments.\n(i) Foreign exchange risk\nThe Group operates entirely in Australia and its costs are primarily\ndenominated in its functional currency, the Australian dollar. Export\ncoal sales are denominated in US dollars and a strengthening of\nthe Australian dollar against the US dollar has an adverse impact\non earnings and cash flow settlement. Liabilities for some plant and\nequipment purchases and loans are denominated in currencies other\nthan the Australian dollar and a weakening of the Australian dollar\nagainst other currencies has an adverse impact on earnings and cash\nflow settlement.\nThe hedging policy of the Group aims to protect against the volatility\nof cash expenditures or reduced collection in the above mentioned\ntransactions as well as to reduce the volatility of profit or loss for\nretranslation of US dollar denominated loans at each period end.\nHedging through bank issued instruments\nOperating foreign exchange risk that arises from firm commitments\nor highly probable transactions are managed through the use of bank\nissued forward foreign currency contracts and collar option contracts.\nThe Group hedges a portion of contracted US dollar sales and asset\npurchases settled in foreign currencies in each currency to mitigate\nthe adverse impact on cash flow due to the future rise or fall in\nAustralian dollars against the relevant currencies.\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are\ndesignated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in Other\nComprehensive Income in the hedging reserve until the anticipated\nunderlying transaction occurs. Once the anticipated underlying\ntransaction occurs, amounts accumulated in equity are recycled\nthrough the profit or loss or recognised as part of the cost of the asset\nto which it relates. The ineffective portion of changes in the fair value\nof derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is\nrecognised immediately in the profit or loss. In the current period, the\nloss relating to the ineffective portion was $nil (2016: $nil).\nD – CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING",

US dollar loan repayments up to a six-month period are\ndesignated to hedge the forecast US dollar sales during the same period after the designation of the hedge relationship based on a dollar for\ndollar basis until the hedge ratio reaches one.\nHedging effectiveness is determined by comparing the changes in the hedging instruments and hedged sales. Hedge ineffectiveness will occur\nwhen cash flows generated by sales transactions are lower than the forecast sales transaction. In cases of hedge ineffectiveness, gains or\nlosses in relation to the excess portion in the foreign exchange movement of the designated US dollar loan repayment will be recycled to profit\nor loss.

The Group’s exposure to other foreign exchange movements is not material. The Group has used the observed range of actual\nhistorical rates for the preceding five year period, with a heavier weighting placed on recently observed market data, in determining reasonably\npossible exchange movements to be used for the current year’s sensitivity analysis.

Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, favourable derivative financial instruments and\ndeposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to wholesale and retail customers, including outstanding receivables\nand committed transactions. For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of ‘A’ are accepted. If\nwholesale customers are independently rated, these ratings are used. Otherwise, if there is no independent rating, the marketing department\nassesses the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors.\nCredit risk in trade receivables is managed in the following ways:\n(i)\t payment terms and credit limits are set for individual customers;\n(ii)\t a risk assessment process is used for all customers; and\n(iii)\t letters of credit are required for those customers assessed as posing a higher risk.\nThe maximum exposure to credit risk on financial assets which have been recognised in the balance sheet is their carrying amount less\nimpairment provision, if any as set out below.\n31 December\n2017\n$M\n31 December\n2016\n$M\nCash and cash equivalents\n207\n222\nTrade and other receivables\n1,131\n842\n1,338\n1,064\nIncluded in trade and other receivables are significant customers located in Singapore, Japan, Australia, and Hong Kong that account for 30%,\n23%, 14% and 8% of trade receivables respectively (2016: Australia 46%, Singapore 22%, South Korea 7% and China 4%).\nAt 31 December 2017, no derivative financial instruments were outstanding (2016: net liability position). As a result no credit risk has been\ndisclosed above.\n(c) Liquidity risk\nLiquidity risk includes the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group will be impacted in the\nfollowing ways:\n(i)\t will not have sufficient funds to settle transactions on the due date;\n(ii)\t will be forced to sell financial assets at a value which is less than what they are worth; or\n(iii)\t may be unable to settle or recover a financial asset at all.\nLiquidity risk is managed by maintaining sufficient cash and liquid deposit balances and having readily accessible standby facilities in place in\naccordance with the Board’s risk management policy. Details regarding finance facilities are set out in Note D2.\nMaturities of financial liabilities\nThe tables below analyse the Group’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on their contractual maturities for:\n(a)\t all non-derivative financial liabilities, and\n(b)\t net and gross settled derivative financial instruments for which the contractual maturities are essential for an understanding of the timing of\nthe cash flows.\nThe amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows including interest payments. Balances due within 12 months\nequal their carrying balances as the impact of discounting is not significant.\nD – CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING",

These valuation\ntechniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are\nobservable, the instrument is included in level 2.\nIf one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.

The financial asset has a finite life being the life of the Middlemount Mine and will be measured on a fair value basis.\nThe fair value is determined using the discounted future cash flows that are dependent on the following unobservable inputs: forecast sales\nvolumes, coal prices and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The forecast sales volumes are based on the internally maintained budgets, five\nyear business plan and life of mine models. The forecast coal prices and long term exchange rates are based on external data consistent with\nthe data used for impairment assessments (refer to Note C3). The risk-adjusted post-tax discount rate used to determine the future cash flows\nis 10%.\nThe estimated fair value could increase significantly if the following unobservable inputs of sales volumes and coal prices were higher and if the\nAustralian dollar weakens against the US dollar.

The consideration transferred\nfor the acquisition of a subsidiary comprises the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by\nthe Group. The consideration transferred also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration arrangement and the fair value of any\npre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary. Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred with the exception of stamp duty. Identifiable\nassets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at\ntheir fair values at the acquisition date.\nThe excess of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition date fair value\nof any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets acquired is recorded as\ngoodwill. If those amounts are less than the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the subsidiary acquired and the measurement of all\namounts has been reviewed, the difference is recognised directly in profit or loss as a gain on acquisition of subsidiaries.\nCritical accounting estimates and judgements\nAcquisition accounting\nAccounting for acquisition of businesses requires judgement and estimates in determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities.\nTechniques used to determine the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities include an income & cost approach for mining tenements and\ndepreciated replacement cost for the valuation of property, plant and equipment.\nThe relevant accounting standard allows the fair value of assets acquired to be refined for a window of one year after the acquisition date,\nand judgement is required to ensure the adjustments made reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed\nas of the acquisition date. The adjustments made on fair value of assets are retrospective in nature and have an impact on goodwill or gain\nrecognised on acquisition.\nAcquisition of Coal & Allied\n(a) Summary of acquisition\nAs announced on 24 January 2017 and as subsequently amended on 26 June 2017, the Company entered into a binding agreement to acquire\n100% of the shares in Coal & Allied from wholly owned subsidiaries of Rio Tinto for US$2.69 billion plus an adjustment for net debt and working\ncapital. US$2.45 billion was paid on completion, plus US$240 million in non-contingent royalty payments over five years from completion. The\nAcquisition completed on 1 September 2017 resulting in the Company acquiring (through its ownership of the shares in Coal & Allied) Rio Tinto’s\ninterest in the Hunter Valley Operations (HVO) and Mount Thorley Warkworth (MTW) mines (an integrated operation of two open-cut mines\nlocated adjacent to each other in the Hunter Valley, NSW), a 36.5% interest in PWCS (the owner of a coal export terminal located at the Port of\nNewcastle), as well as other coal exploration projects and landholdings.\n(b) Transaction funding and capital structure simplification\nOn 31 August funding for the acquisition of Coal & Allied was achieved by the Company successfully completing the issue of new fully paid\nordinary shares (“New Shares”) under the pro-rata renounceable entitlement offer (“Entitlement Offer”) and institutional placement (“Placement”)\nannounced to ASX on 1 August 2017. New Shares under the Entitlement Offer and Placement were issued at the offer price of US$0.10\n(“Offer Price”).\nYancoal issued:\n––\n23,464,929,520 New Shares under the Entitlement Offer, raising gross proceeds of US$2,346,492,952; and\n––\n1,500,000,000 New Shares under the Placement, raising gross proceeds of US$150,000,000.\nIn addition, the Company issued 18,000,031,000 New Shares to Yanzhou Coal Mining Co., Ltd (“Yanzhou”) on conversion of all of its\nsubordinated capital notes (“SCN”) at a conversion price of US$0.10 per New Share, in accordance with the SCN terms of issue. Yancoal has\nalso issued a further 150,943 New Shares on conversion of 80 other SCNs for which a conversion notice was received, at a conversion price of\nUS$0.053 per New Share, in accordance with the SCN terms of issue.\nE – GROUP STRUCTURE",

Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of\naccounting, after initially being recognised at cost. The Group’s investments in associates includes goodwill identified on acquisition.\nThe Group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in profit or loss, and its share of post-acquisition other\ncomprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against\nthe carrying amount of the investment. Dividends receivable from associates are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of\nthe investment.\n(ii) Joint arrangements\nA joint arrangement is a contractual arrangement whereby two or more parties undertake economic activities under joint control. Joint\ncontrol exists only when the strategic, financial and operational policy decisions relating to the activities of the joint arrangement require the\nunanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\nA joint arrangement is either a joint operation or a joint venture. The structure of each joint arrangement is analysed to determine whether\nthe joint arrangement is a joint operation or a joint venture. The classification of a joint arrangement is dependent on the rights and\nobligations of the parties to the arrangement.\nJoint operations\nThe Group recognises its proportional right to the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations and its share of any\njointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These have been incorporated in the financial statements under the\nappropriate headings.\nJoint ventures\nA joint venture is structured through a separate vehicle and the parties have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Joint ventures are\naccounted for using the equity method where the assets and liabilities will be aggregated into one line item on the face of the consolidated\nbalance sheet, after adjusting for the share of profit or loss after tax, which is shown as a separate line item on the face of the Consolidated\nStatement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income, after adjusting for amounts recognised directly in equity.\nWhen the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the joint venture (which includes any long-term interests\nthat, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the joint venture), the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has\nincurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.\nUnrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the\njoint ventures. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.\nAccounting policies of the joint ventures have been changed where necessary, to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by\nthe Group.\nCritical accounting estimates and judgements\nThere is significant judgement in assessing whether the Group controls Watagan. Even though it holds 100% of the nominal share capital.\nAn assessment has been made that in accordance with the accounting standards the Group does not control Watagan as it is not able to\ndirect the relevant activities of Watagan and accounts for its interest in Watagan as an associate.",

The Group has the right to appoint a\ndirector and is currently represented on the Board to partake in policy-making processes.\nWatagan Mining Company Pty Ltd\nDuring 2015 the Group established a 100% owned subsidiary, Watagan Mining Company Pty Ltd (“Watagan”). On 18 February 2016, the\nGroup executed a Bond Subscription Agreement, together with other agreements (the “Watagan Agreements”) that, on completion, transferred\nthe Group’s interest in three of its 100% owned NSW coal mining operations, being the Austar, Ashton and Donaldson coal mines (the “three\nmines”), to Watagan for a purchase price of $1,363.4 million (an amount equal to the book value of the three mines at completion). The purchase\nprice was funded by way of a $1,363.4 million loan from Yancoal Australia Ltd to Watagan bearing interest at BBSY plus 7.06% with a maturity\ndate of 1 April 2025. The outstanding interest and principal of this loan is guaranteed by Yankuang Group Co., Ltd (“Yankuang”), the Group’s\nultimate parent entity. The completion date of the transaction was 31 March 2016.\nOn completion Watagan issued US$775 million of secured debt bonds with a term of approximately nine years to three external financiers\n(“Bondholders”). The Bondholders will receive interest on the face value outstanding on the bonds comprising a fixed interest component, as\nwell as a variable interest component that is tied to the EBITDA performance of Watagan. Under the terms of the Watagan Agreements, it was\ndetermined that upon issuance of the bonds the Group lost control of Watagan.\nThis loss of control was determined to occur on the issuance date of the bonds on the basis that the power over the key operating and strategic\ndecisions of Watagan no longer reside with the Group. Specifically, those powers were transferred to the Bondholders under the terms of the\nWatagan Agreements as the Bondholders were given control of Watagan’s board of directors via appointment of the majority of directors. This\nloss of control resulted in the Group de-consolidating the consolidated results of Watagan from the transaction completion date and the Group\nbegan to equity account for its 100% equity interest in Watagan as an associate.\nWhile Watagan is deconsolidated for accounting purposes, as a result of the Group’s ongoing 100% equity ownership it remains within the\nGroup’s tax consolidated group.\nE – GROUP STRUCTURE",

The funding amounts are determined by reference to the amounts recognised in the wholly-owned entities’ financial statements.\nThe amounts receivable/payable under the tax funding agreement are due upon receipt of the funding advice from the head entity, which is\nissued as soon as practicable after the end of each financial year. The head entity may also require payment of interim funding amounts to\nassist with its obligations to pay tax instalments.\nAssets or liabilities arising under tax funding agreements with the tax consolidated entities are recognised as current amounts receivable\nfrom or payable to other entities in the Group.\nAny difference between the amounts assumed and amounts receivable or payable under the tax funding agreement are recognised as a\ncontribution to (or distribution from) wholly owned tax consolidated entities.\n(a) Summary financial information\nThe individual financial statements for the parent entity, Yancoal Australia Ltd show the following aggregate amounts:\n31 December\n2017\n$M\n31 December\n2016\n$M\nCurrent assets\n361\n232\nNon-current assets\n9,850\n6,780\nTotal assets\n10,211\n7,012\nCurrent liabilities\n1,134\n163\nNon-current liabilities\n4,651\n5,303\nTotal liabilities\n5,785\n5,466\nNet assets\n4,426\n1,546\nShareholders’ equity\nContributed equity\n6,217\n3,115\nReserves\nCash flow hedges\n(413)\n(817)\nRetained earnings\n(1,378)\n(752)\nCapital and reserves attributable to the owners of Yancoal Australia Ltd\n4,426\n1,546\nLoss for the year\n(550)\n(1,066)\nOther comprehensive income\n376\n90\nTotal comprehensive expense\n(174)\n(976)\n(b) Guarantees entered into by the parent entity\nAs at 31 December 2017, the parent entity had contingent liabilities in the form of a bank guarantee amounting to $1,041 million (2016:\n$441 million) in support of the operation of the entity, its subsidiaries and related parties (refer to Note E3).\n(c) Contingent liabilities of the parent entity\nThere are cross guarantees given by Yancoal Australia Ltd and certain subsidiaries as described in Note E5.\nThe parent entity did not have any contingent liabilities as at 31 December 2017, except for those described in Note D7.",

Income and expense items are translated\nat the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates\nfluctuated significantly during that period, in which case the exchange\nrates at the dates of the transactions are used. Exchange differences\narising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and\naccumulated in equity.\n(ii) Transactions and balances\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional\ncurrency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the\ntransactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the\nsettlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end\nexchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in\nforeign currencies are recognised in profit or loss, except when they\nare deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges.\nNon-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign\ncurrency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when\nthe fair value was determined. Translation differences on assets and\nliabilities carried at fair value are reported as part of the fair value gain\nor loss. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical\ncost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at\nthe date of the transaction.\nF6 NEW AND AMENDED STANDARDS ADOPTED BY THE GROUP\nThe Group was not required to change any of its accounting\npolicies as the result of new or revised accounting standards which\nbecame effective for the annual reporting period commencing on\n1 January 2017.\nThe new standards that are applicable to for the first time for the year\nended 31 December 2017 are:\nAASB 1057 – Application of Australian Accounting Standards\nAASB 2014 – 4 – Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards\n– Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation\nand Amortisation\nAASB 2014 – 9 – Equity Accounting in Separate Financial Statements\nAASB 2014 –10 – Sale or Contribution of Assets between An Investor\nand its Associate or Joint Venture\nAASB 2015 – 1 – Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards\n– Annual Improvements to Australian Accounting Standards\n2012-2014 Cycle\nAASB 2015 – 3 – Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards\narising from the Withdrawal of AASB 1031 Materiality\nAASB 2015 – 4 – Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards\n– Financial Reporting Requirements for Australian Groups with a\nForeign Parent\nAASB 2015 – 5 – Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards\n– Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception\nAASB 2015 – 9 – Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards\n– Scope and Application Paragraphs\nThese standards have introduced new disclosures for the Annual\nFinancial Report but did not affect the Group’s accounting policies or\nany of the amounts recognised in the financial statements.\nF – OTHER INFORMATION",

The available-for-sale\nand held-to-maturity categories of financial assets in AASB 139 have been eliminated. Under AASB 9,\nthere are three categories of financial assets:\na)\t Amortised cost\nb)\t Fair value through profit or loss\nc)\t Fair value through other comprehensive income\nThe standard introduces an ‘expected credit loss’ model for the measurement of the impairment of\nfinancial assets, so it is no longer necessary for a credit event to have occurred before a credit loss\nis recognised.\nThe following requirements have generally been carried forward unchanged from AASB 139 Financial\nInstruments: Recognition and Measurement into AASB 9:\na)\t Classification and measurement of financial liabilities; and\nb)\t Derecognition requirements for financial assets and liabilities\nHowever, AASB 9 requires that gains or losses on financial liabilities measured at fair value are recognised\nin profit or loss, except that the effects of changes in the liability’s credit risk are recognised in other\ncomprehensive income.\nImpact:\nThe Directors anticipate that the adoption of AASB 9 will have no impact on the recognition of amounts\nin the Group’s financial statements, including hedging activity, it is impracticable at this stage to provide a\nreasonable estimate of such impact, but there will be additional disclosures required.\n1 January 2018\nAASB 16\nLeases\nThis standard introduces a single lessee accounting model that eliminates the requirement for leases to\nbe classified as operating or finance leases.\nThe main changes introduced by the new standard include:\na)\t Recognition of a right-to-use asset and liability for all leases (excluding short term leases with less than\n12 months of tenure an leases relating to low value assets);\nb)\t Deprecation of right-to-use assets in-line with AASB 116 Property, plant and equipment in profit or\nloss and unwinding of the liability in principal and interest components;\nc)\t Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate are included in the initial measurement of\nthe lease liability using the index or rate at the commencement date;\nd)\t By applying a practical expedient, a lessee is permitted to elect not to separate non-lease components\nand instead account all components as a lease; and\ne)\t Additional disclosure requirements.\nImpact:\nAlthough the Directors anticipate that the adoption of AASB 16 will impact the Group’s financial\nstatements, it is impracticable at this stage to provide a reasonable estimate of such impact.\n1 January 2019\nAASB 15\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nAn entity will recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers\nin an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange\nfor those goods or services. This means that revenue will be recognised when control of goods or\nservices is transferred, rather than on transfer of risks and rewards as is currently the case under AASB\n118 Revenue.\nImpact:\nThe Directors anticipate that the adoption of AASB 15 will have no impact on the recognition of amounts\nin the Group’s financial statements, but there will be additional disclosures required.\n1 January 2018",

The\nremaining gain or loss should be eliminated against the carrying amount of the remaining investment.\nThe application of AASB 2014-10 will result in a change in accounting policies for transactions of loss of\ncontrol over subsidiaries (involving an associate or joint venture) that are businesses per AASB 3 for which\ngains or losses were previously recognised only to the extent of the unrelated investor’s interest.\nImpact:\nThe Group is currently adhering to this standard and there is no material impact expected on the Group’s\nfinancial report.\n1 January 2018\nAASB 2016-5\nAmendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Classification and\nMeasurement of Share-based Payment Transactions\nThis standard provides guidance on treatment of vesting conditions in a cash-settled share based\npayment arrangement that are similar to what has been prescribed for equity settled share based\npayment arrangements.

      "text_content": "INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT (CONTINUED)\n148      YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\n148\nKey Audit Matter\nHow the matter was addressed during the audit\nAcquisition of Coal & Allied Industries Limited\n(“Coal & Allied”)\n(Note E1)\nThe Group acquired 100% of the issued capital of Coal\n& Allied on 1 September 2017 for total consideration of\n$3.55 billion. The net assets acquired were valued at\n$3.72 billion, leading to a gain on acquisition of $176\nmillion being recognised.\nThe Group is required to recognise Coal & Allied’s\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed at the\nacquisition-date fair values; and the excess or deficit of\nconsideration less those fair values as goodwill or gain\non acquisition. Yancoal management engaged third-\nparty experts to provide valuation, tax and business\nmodelling support to determine the fair values of Coal &\nAllied’s assets and liabilities under AASB 3 Business\nCombinations.\nThere is a high level of judgement involved in\ncalculating the fair value of assets and liabilities\nacquired; particularly the valuation of mining tenements\nand associated tax balances. Given the extent of\njudgement required we consider this a significant risk of\nmaterial misstatement.\nOur audit procedures included, among others:\n• Assessing the source and appropriateness of key\nassumptions made in the purchase price allocation,\nincluding coal prices, life of mine plans,\noperating/capital costs, discount rates, inflation rates\nand foreign exchange rates. We compared these\nassumptions with external benchmarks and reports\nprepared by appropriate experts;\n• In assessing key assumptions, we utilised our\nvaluation experts who assisted with assessing the\nvaluation methodology against accepted industry\npractice, discount rates, cross checks of the valuation,\ncoal prices and forecast foreign exchange rates;\n• Comparing the accounting valuation and taxation\nvaluation to check the deferred taxation calculations to\nconsider whether deferred taxation balances were\nrecognised appropriately;\n• Agreeing the consideration paid to supporting\ndocumentation, agreeing the accounting entries and\nrecalculating the gain on acquisition; and\n• Assessing the Group’s acquisition accounting\ndisclosures.\nImpairment of non-current assets and associated\nMoolarben impairment reversal\n(Note C3)\nA substantial amount of the Group’s non-current assets\n(over 80%) relate to tangible and intangible assets\nwhich are subject to an impairment assessment in\naccordance with AASB 136 Impairment of Assets or\nAASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and\nMeasurement.\nThese assets include property plant and equipment\n(note C1), mining tenements (note C2), intangible\nassets (note C5), interest bearing loan to associate\n(note D1) and royalty receivable (note C9), receivables\nfrom joint venture and other receivables from WICET\n(note C7).\nIn performing the impairment assessment, the\nimpairment provision associated with Moolarben was\nreversed as the mine’s financial metrics and operations\nhave improved significantly and the net realisable value\nof the Moolarben asset is above the book value of the\nmine with substantial headroom an impairment reversal\nof $100 million before income tax was recognised.\nManagement’s impairment assessment of these non-\ncurrent assets are considered a key audit matter as they\nare often highly judgmental and based on many\nassumptions, specifically coal prices, operating/capital\ncosts, discount rates, inflation rates and foreign\nexchange rates, which are affected by expected future\nOur audit procedures included, among others:\n• Assessing management’s determination of the\nGroup’s Cash-Generating Units;\n• Engaging our valuation team who assisted with the\nreview of the asset valuation model;\n• Agreeing the assumptions used in the asset valuation\nmodel such as discount rate, resource prices,\nexchange rates, production and sales volumes, coal\nresources and reserves, operating and other costs;\nand agreeing the appropriateness of the valuation\nmethodology used;\n• Testing the mathematical accuracy of discounted cash\nflow models and agreeing relevant data to supporting\ninformation;\n• Performing sensitivity analyses on key inputs; and\n• Assessing the Group’s impairment of assets\ndisclosures.",

The Group estimates its tax\nliabilities based on the Group’s understanding of the tax\nlaw. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is\ndifferent from the amounts that were initially recorded,\nsuch differences will impact the current and deferred\nincome tax assets and liabilities in the period in which\nsuch determination is made.\nDuring the year the Group completed a significant\ncapital raising to acquire Coal& Allied. In conjunction\nwith the capital raising for the Coal & Allied acquisition,\nYanzhou Coal Mining Company Limited (“Yanzhou”)\nconverted its holdings of Subordinated Capital Notes\n(“SCNs”) into ordinary shares of Yancoal. Due to these\ntransactions the applicability of prior period losses\nneeded to be assessed against the Continuity of\nOwnership Test (“COT”).\nSignificant judgement is required in calculating taxation\nbalances and the recoverability of the net deferred tax\nassets (notes B6(b) and B6(c)). To assess the\nrecoverability of these assets cash flow forecasts are\nused to ascertain whether the recoverability of these\nassets is probable.\nOur audit procedures included, among others:\n• Assessing the tax calculations prepared by the Group;\n• Evaluating the key assumptions used to determine the\ntax provision and deferred taxation assets and\nliabilities. This included utilising our taxation specialists\nwhere necessary;\n• Evaluating the recoverability of deferred taxation\nassets including considering the COT; and\n• We assessed the Group’s taxation disclosures.\nParent company support\n(Note A(x))\nThe Group has the support of its parent Yanzhou Coal\nMining Company Ltd (“Yanzhou”) through a letter of\nsupport and guarantees over external borrowings.\nThe Group is in the process of completing the\nacquisition of 28.9% of Warkworth from Mitsubishi\nDevelopment Pty Ltd (“MDP”) for US$230 million on 1\nMarch 2017 and the expected sale of 16.6% of the\nHunter Valley Operations Joint Venture (“HVO”) to a\nsubsidiary of Glencore Coal Pty Ltd (“Glencore”).\nIf the sale of the 16.6% of HVO is not completed then\nthe Group will be required to complete the tag-along\npurchase of 32.4% of HVO from MDP for US$710\nmillion. This will require additional funding from capital\nmarkets, the financiers or Yanzhou.\nOur audit procedures included, among others:\n• Assessing the cash flow forecasts prepared by\nmanagement for the 12 months from the date of\nsigning the financial statements;\n• Assessing the credit facilities available to Yancoal to\nassess their adequacy compared to the cash flow\nforecasts;\n• Assessing the validity of the Letter of Support provided\nby Yanzhou to supporting information including\nYanzhou financial statements;\n• Reviewing the minutes and correspondence of the\nCompany for any revocation of the Letter of Support\nprovided by Yanzhou; and\n• Assessing the Group’s disclosures in relation to this\nmatter.\nWatagan Mining Company Pty Ltd (“Watagan”)\n(Note E2(b)(i))\nEven though the Group holds 100% of the nominal\nshare capital of Watagan the Directors have assessed\nthat the Group does not control Watagan as it is not\nable to direct the relevant activities of Watagan.\nOur audit procedures included, among others:\n• Assessing the current governance arrangements of\nWatagan against AASB 10 Consolidated Financial\nStatements to assess whether the financiers have\ncontrol of the operations.",

The\ntwo largest shareholders were Yanzhou with 65.5% holding and\nCinda International HGB Investment (UK) Limited with 16.7%.\n\n\n1 Yanzhou is a China-based, integrated mining company with interests in coal, coal\nchemicals, power generation and mechanical and electrical equipment manufacturing.\nIts shares are listed on the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges. The State-owned\nYankuang Group Company Limited has a 51.59% direct shareholding in Yanzhou.\n\n\n2 Watagan Mining Company Pty Ltd is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Yancoal Australia\nLtd, controlled by a consortium of financiers consisting of Industrial Bank Co. Ltd,\nBOCI Financial Products Limited and United NSW Energy Limited. Effective 31 March\n2016, Yancoal ceased to control Watagan and remains the exclusive provider of mine\nmanagement, marketing, infrastructure and other corporate support services for the\nAshton, Austar and Donaldson assets.\n\n\nANNUAL REPORT **2017** **3**\n\n\n**28.54** **Mt** **[1]**\n\n\n**SALES VOLUME**\n(EQUITY SHARE TONNES)\n\n\nTotal coal sales (equity share) of\n28.5Mt for the year, with a sales\nsplit (equity share) for the period\nof 19.55Mt thermal coal and 8.99Mt\n\nmetallurgical coal.\n\n**30.55** **Mt**\n**RUN OF MINE COAL** **[2]**\n(EQUITY SHARE TONNES)\n\n\nConsistently strong production from\nthe Moolarben complex, supported\nby fleet efficiencies across open cut\nmines and the addition of coal from\nthe acquired Coal & Allied assets\ndrove a total 30.55 million tonnes Run\nof Mine (ROM) coal (equity share).\n\n\n**$** **229** **M**\n\n**PROFIT AFTER TAX**\n\n\nYancoal reported a Full Year 2017\nprofit after tax of $229 million, led\nby increased production output at\na time of industry-high benchmark\nprices for semi-soft coking coal\nand thermal coal sales.\n\n\n**$** **732** **M**\n\n**OPERATING EBIT**\n**TOTAL VALUE**\n\n\nYancoal achieved a total Operating\nEBIT of $732 million before tax,\nup $693 million on the year prior.\n\n\n**$** **2.6** **B**\n\n**TOTAL REVENUE**\n\n\nYancoal generated $2.6 billion\nof revenue.\n\n\n\n\n**4** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\n\n\n**With a long-term vision**\n**for continued investment**\n**into Australian mining,**\n**Yancoal is a leader in the**\n\n**local resources sector**\n**committed to building**\n**new opportunities for its**\n**employees and generating**\n**value for its shareholders.**\n\n\nOPERATING PERFORMANCE\n\n\nThe addition of attributable production from the\nnewly acquired Mount Thorley Warkworth and Hunter\nValley Operations mines generated an immediate\nand significant increase in production, achieving total\nsaleable coal production of 31.5Mt (23.4Mt equity\nshare) for the year (31 December 2016: 16.0Mt\nequity share) and total Run of Mine (“ROM”) coal\nproduction of 41.1Mt (30.6Mt equity share) for the\nyear (31 December 2016: 21.2Mt equity share).\n\n\nYancoal achieved total coal sales (equity share)\nof 28.5Mt [1] for the year (31 December 2016: 19.3Mt),\nwith a sales split (equity share) for the period\nof 19.6Mt (2016 11.6Mt) thermal coal and 8.99Mt\n(2016 7.7Mt) metallurgical coal.\n\n\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\n\n\nYancoal achieved a total operating EBIT of $732 million\nbefore tax, up $693 million on the year prior.\n\nYancoal’s financial improvement was mostly\nattributable to the strategic acquisition of 100%\nof Coal & Allied Industries Limited from Rio Tinto for\nUS$2.69 billion in value, as at 1 September 2017,\nresulting in a significant increase in production.\n\n\nIncreased production output at a time of industry-high\nbenchmark prices for semi-soft coking and thermal\ncoals led Yancoal’s recovery to announce a profit after\ntax of $229 million from revenue of $2.6 billion for the\nyear ended 31 December 2017.\n\n\n1 Includes external coal purchases, Middlemount and Watagan. Includes only 51%\ninterest in Hunter Valley Operations (“HVO”) on the basis that Glencore will be\nentitled to a 49% interest in HVO with economic effect from 1 September 2017\non implementation of the Yancoal-Glencore HVO joint venture.\n\n\nANNUAL REPORT **2017** **7**\n\n\n**8** **YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD**\n\n###### CHAIRMAN’S LETTER\n\n\n**2017 has been a year of transformation**\n**for Yancoal Australia. Our strategic**\n**acquisition of Coal & Allied redefined**\n**our business as Australia’s largest**\n**pure-play coal producer and a major**\n**contributor to global coal markets.**\n\n\n**XIYONG LI**\n\nCHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD\n\n\n**TURNAROUND**\n\n\nThe substantial cash flows generated from\nthe acquired Coal & Allied assets, combined\nwith the associated operational synergies\nand benefits of our equity raising, have\nimmediately and materially strengthened\nYancoal’s balance sheet.\n\n\nIt is with great pleasure we have announced\nYancoal’s recovery to profit, achieving a total\noperating EBIT of $732 million before tax, up\n$693 million on the year prior, and a profit after\ntax of $229 million from revenue of $2.6 billion.\n\nThis significant turnaround is mostly attributable\nto the successful completion of the Coal\n& Allied transaction at a time of increasing\npricing strength and sustainability across the\nmetallurgical and thermal coal markets.\n\n\n**PRODUCTION INCREASE**\n\n\nThe addition of attributable production from\nthe newly acquired Mount Thorley Warkworth\nand Hunter Valley Operations mines generated\nan immediate and significant increase in\nproduction, allowing Yancoal to maximise\nsales and blending at a time of benchmark-high\npricing for semi-soft and thermal coals with\nkey buyers.\n\n\nYancoal achieved total saleable coal production\nof 31.5Mt (23.4Mt equity share) for the year\n(31 December 2016: 16.0Mt equity share) and\ntotal Run of Mine (“ROM”) coal production of\n41.1Mt (30.6Mt equity share) for the year\n(31 December 2016: 21.2Mt equity share).\n\n\nSuch a strong production result includes only\nfour months of attributable activity from the\nnewly acquired tier-one assets and clearly\ndemonstrates Yancoal is very well positioned to\nrealise significant value for our shareholders in\nthe years ahead.\n\n\nCombining the world-class assets of Coal &\nAllied’s Mount Thorley Warkworth and Hunter\nValley Operations with the Company’s existing\nportfolio, the acquisition enables the maximising\nof synergies between Yancoal assets and\nsupports the Company’s vision for continued\nmarket growth.\n\n\n**THE ACQUISITION**\n\n\nCritically, we approached our competitive\nbid for Coal & Allied with a commitment to\n\npricing-discipline, ensuring we negotiated a\ncommercially robust offer in the best interests\nof all parties of US$2.45 billion cash payable\non completion, plus US$240 million in future\nnon-contingent royalty payments over five years\nfollowing completion, and a coal price linked\ncontingent royalty.\n\n\nTo support the funding of the acquisition,\nYancoal also conducted a pro-rata\nrenounceable entitlement offer of\n\n23,464,929,520 fully paid ordinary shares\nto raise US$2.35 billion, and an associated\nplacement of 1,500,000,000 fully paid ordinary\nshares to raise a further US$150 million.\n\n\nThe pro-rata entitlement offer attracted new\ninvestors, provided greater depth to our\nshareholder base, and efficiently generated\nthe necessary funding to support the next\nstage of our business’ evolution.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, Yancoal also entered into\na binding agreement to establish a 51:49\nunincorporated joint venture with Glencore in\nrelation to the Hunter Valley Operations asset,\nfollowing completion of the acquisition.\n\n\nThe joint venture arrangement provides\nsignificant combined synergies and\ncommercial opportunities for both Yancoal\nand Glencore, with shareholders set to\nbenefit from the co-operative management\nexperience and operational skills of two\nof Australia’s leading coal producers. The\njoint venture remains subject to Glencore\nachieving all required approvals.\n\n\n**SHAREHOLDER SUPPORT**\n\n\nThroughout the transaction Yancoal operated\nswiftly and with certainty, supported by our\nmajority shareholder, Yanzhou Coal Mining\nCompany Ltd, and Yanzhou’s 56 percent\nshareholder, Yankuang Group Company Ltd.\n\n\nYanzhou shares Yancoal’s commitment to\n\ncontinuous improvement and a belief in\noperating to the highest standards of safety,\nintegrity, excellence and with respect for our\npeople and the countries in which we operate.\n\n\nWith their continued investment and that of\n\nour new second-largest shareholder Cinda\nInternational HGB Investment (UK) Limited,\nwe have demonstrated Yancoal’s long term\ncommitment to the local resources sector as a\nsignificant employer and exporter for Australia.\n\nInvesting within Australia requires flexibility,\nbravery, certainty and an ability to trust the\nmanagement team working within the country.\nThe strategic acquisition of Coal & Allied is a\ncredit to the management teams of Yancoal\nand our majority shareholders.\n\n\n**OPERATIONAL STRENGTH**\n\n\nFollowing the completion of the transaction on\n1 September 2017, we have successfully and\nefficiently integrated the people, processes\nand systems of the newly acquired assets into\nthe Yancoal Group. Sharing our values and\ncore operating principles across operations to\nensure we are culturally aligned and focused\non achieving our production goals for the\nyear ahead.\n\n\n\nANNUAL REPORT **2017** **9**\n\n\nWith this transaction Yancoal’s Board\n\nand executive have increased the capability\nand capacity required to generate new\norganic growth.\n\n\nWe have also maintained our strength in\nproject management, completing the Stage\nTwo Moolarben underground mine ahead of\nschedule and below budget, commencing\nlongwall mining in October.\n\n\nOur strategic decision to commit to the\ndevelopment of the Moolarben Stage Two\nProject in 2014 during the global coal market\ndownturn, has appropriately prepared our\nbusiness to respond swiftly and with surety\nto the recent price recovery.\n\nWe are now reaping the benefits of our early\nproject investment and belief in the long-term\nreturn of the global market, understanding\nthe risks and opportunities of the mining cycle.\n\n\n**MOVING FORWARD**\n\n\nWhile there is much work ahead for all of our\n\nteams, we retain a positive outlook towards\nthe continued improvement within established\nand untapped developing global coal markets.\n\n\nWe also continue to focus on achieving our\ngoal of operating without injury and achieving\ncost-efficiencies across the Group.\n\n\nOn behalf of the Board I would like to thank\n\nour people for their drive and dedication to\nsafe production and instituting the highest\noperating standards.\n\nTogether, our people have fortified Yancoal\nagainst recent years of turbulent market\nforces and challenging operating conditions\nto overcome and establish our business as\n\na true global market leader.\n\n\nWith the support of our majority shareholders\nand our joint venture and marketing partners,\nYancoal Australia has the leadership, asset\nportfolio, experience, and long term strategy\nrequired to build a brighter future for all.\n\n\nAs we enter 2018, Yancoal is ready for the\nnext exciting step in our continuing journey.\n\n\n# **$ 732 M**\n\nUP $693 M\n\n\nTOTAL OPERATING EBIT\nFOR 2017\n\n\n**With a commitment to continued**\n**strategic growth and maximising**\n**new opportunities, Yancoal remains**\n**focused on returning shareholder**\n**value and building its business as a**\n**leading competitor in global markets.**\n\n##### OUR STRATEGY\n\n\n**12** **YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD**\n\n###### CEO’S STATEMENT\n\n\n**In 2017, Yancoal surpassed industry**\n**expectations to successfully acquire**\n**Coal & Allied from Rio Tinto in a**\n**competitive acquisition, effectively**\n**doubling the scale of our operations**\n**and employee numbers.**\n\n\n**REINHOLD SCHMIDT**\n\nCEO YANCOAL AUSTRALIA\n\n\nANNUAL REPORT **2017** **13**\n\n\nWe must also continue to play an important\nrole in financially contributing to local and\nregional employment, training, health and\neducation initiatives we believe capable of\nmaking a positive difference.\n\n\nWithin the past year we have contributed\nmore than $1.3m to community-focused\ninitiatives via our Community Support\nProgram and I look forward to our new\noperations playing a major role in supporting\nand establishing viable and sustainable\nregional programs.\n\n\n**THE YEAR AHEAD**\n\n\nRenewed global demand for high quality\ncoal, buoyed by improved coal prices will\ncontinue to strengthen Yancoal’s performance\nas we progress the development of our\nopen cut operations and continue to pursue\nnew marketing and blending opportunities.\n\n\nMoving forward, we are well advanced in\nour preparations for the eventual\nimplementation of our joint venture with\nGlencore at Hunter Valley Operations,\nsubject to final approvals.\n\n\nThe joint venture will ultimately provide\nHunter Valley Operations with the opportunity\nto benefit from substantial synergies from\nGlencore’s adjoining operations and both\nparties look forward to working together to\ndrive new market growth.\n\n\nVia the transaction we have also attained a\n\n36.5% share of ownership of Port Waratah\nCoal Services Limited.\n\n\n**AUSTRALIA’S LARGEST PURE-PLAY**\n**COAL PRODUCER**\n\n\nWe are now an established leader within the\n\nAustralian resources sector and have clearly\ndemonstrated we have the capabilities,\nexperience and initiative to exceed\nexpectations within the global marketplace.\n\n\nThis is a new day, a new opportunity and I\nwould like to thank the Yancoal team and our\n\nshareholders for their continuing contribution\nto our growth and success.\n\n\n\nThe expansion of our open cut portfolio at\na time of sustained market price improvements\nhas enabled Yancoal to achieve significant\nproduction gains well beyond our preacquisition performance.\n\n\n**WORKING TOGETHER**\n\n\nOnly three years ago Yancoal was operating\nin a deflated and disappointing resources\nmarket, restructuring our operations\nand managing costs to ensure we were\nready for an eventual upturn.\n\n\nAs prices improved throughout the past year,\nwe have held true to our promises to continue\nto invest into the Australian resources sector,\nemploy from the areas in which we operate,\nand remain absolutely committed to operating\nsafely and transparently.\n\n\nOur transformative acquisition has required\na whole-of-business commitment and\n\nits successful completion is of credit to our\npeople and their ability to anticipate, respond\nand recalibrate to market forces and\n\noperational demands.\n\n\nTogether, we have secured Yancoal’s future as\nAustralia’s largest pure-play coal producer, with\nmajority interests in two of the country’s leading\ntier-one large-scale, long-life and low-cost open\ncut coal mines, adding to the strength of our\nestablished tier-one Moolarben complex.\n\n\n**SAFETY**\n\n\nAs we have increased in scale, we have\nremained focused on ensuring the safety of our\npeople. Remaining ever vigilant in ensuring we\nare providing a safe workplace for the more than\n5,000 people directly responsible for helping\nYancoal achieve its ongoing market success.\n\n\nTo support this commitment, we continue to\nimplement safety training and incident response\npractices across each of our operations,\nincluding the 2017 introduction of a Critical\nControls initiative to identify and mitigate against\nsignificant on-site risks.\n\n\nOnly through continued training, education\nand awareness can we help to ensure each\nof our people returns home safely. There are\nno shortcuts to safety and it is the responsibility\nof every person within our business to be\nwatching out for themselves and those working\nalongside them.\n\n\nWe must never compromise on safety.\n\n\n**TRANSFORMATION**\n\n\nWith our management and operational\nteams successfully integrating the Mount\nThorley Warkworth and Hunter Valley\nOperations assets into our business from\nday one, we have immediately benefitted\nfrom operational synergies and the creation\nof new marketing opportunities.\n\n\nThe Company’s balance sheet strengthened\nvia increased cashflows from a full fourth\nquarter’s contribution of attributable new coal\nproduct sales.\n\n\n\nSales volumes for the fourth quarter reporting\nperiod were up 83 percent on the year prior;\nincluding 3.45 million tonnes, a 56 percent\ncontribution to the year-on-year increase,\nfrom Hunter Valley Operations and Mount\nThorley Warkworth.\n\n\n**OPERATIONS**\n\n\nDuring the year, we achieved a series of\nkey milestones essential to the next stage\nof Yancoal’s continued growth, both organic\nand via strategic acquisition.\n\nOf specific note, we completed the\ncommissioning of the Moolarben Stage Two\nunderground mine ahead of time and below\nbudget, commencing longwall production\nin October.\n\n\nThe completion of the Stage Two expansion,\nconsisting of two open cut pits and the\nnew underground, has now established the\nMoolarben complex as a leading operation\nin New South Wales, benefitting from fleet\nefficiencies introduced in the year prior and\nachieving superior extraction rates both\nabove and below ground.\n\n\nSimultaneously, we have also maintained\nthe necessary operational flexibility and\ndiscipline required to adapt the mine plans\nof our Stratford Duralie and Yarrabee open\ncuts throughout the year to successfully\nimprove extraction rates, reduce costs\nand more efficiently meet changing global\nmarket demands.\n\n\n**COMMUNITY**\n\n\nEmploying the majority of our people from the\nareas in which we operate, and relying on local\ncontractors and service providers to support\nour operations, we remain ever mindful of our\nresponsibilities across regional Australia.\n\n\nIt is up to each of our operations to keep our\nlocal communities engaged and informed.\nOperating to the highest environmental and\nsafety standards, while communicating openly\nand transparently. We cannot continue to grow\nunless our local stakeholders are considered\n\nin our decision-making.\n\n\n\nLooking ahead, there is still much to achieve.\n# **31.5 Mt**\n\n\n\nUP FROM 19.8 Mt\n\n\nSALEABLE COAL PRODUCTION\nFOR 2017 (100% BASIS)\n\n\n**14** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\n\n## MARKET CONTEXT\n\n\n**2017 experienced sustained global**\n**coal market price improvements, with**\n**industry-high benchmark prices for**\n**semi-soft coking and thermal coals**\n**achieved during the reporting period.**\n\n\n\nGUIDANCE\n\n\n2018 guidance for saleable production is\n35 – 37 million tonnes (equity share [1] ).\n\n\n1 Includes Watagan (100%), Middlemount (49.9997%), Yarrabee\n(100%), Stratford Duralie (100%), Moolarben (81%), Mount\nThorley Warkworth (82.9% from 1 March 2018), and Hunter\nValley Operations (51% on the basis that Glencore will be\nentitled to a 49% interest in Hunter Valley Operations with\neconomic effect from 1 September 2017 on implementation of\nthe Hunter Valley Operations Joint Venture). The Hunter Valley\nOperations Joint Venture remains subject to Glencore achieving\nall required approvals.\n\n\n\nThroughout 2017, Yancoal continued to\nimplement cost reduction strategies across\nall operations, addressed existing take-or-pay\narrangements, and blended products\nacross the New South Wales operations\n(both managed and operated) to meet\nnew market opportunities.\n\n\nYancoal’s product sales split (equity share)\nfor 2017 was 19.6Mt (2016 11.6Mt) thermal\nand 8.99Mt (2016 7.7Mt) metallurgical coal.\n\n\nYancoal Australia Sales Pty Ltd (YAS)\ncontinued to facilitate the sale of coal blends,\ncontracting with and paying the supplying\ncoal mines, whether operated wholly or in joint\nventure by a Yancoal subsidiary, an asset\nmanaged by Yancoal Australia Ltd on behalf\nof Yancoal International (Holding) Co. Ltd,\nor a third-party mine.\n\n\n\nOUTLOOK\n\n\nRecent increases in metallurgical coal prices\nare expected to hold, allowing for ongoing\nprice strength, as high demand for hard\ncoking coal across China, India, Europe and\nSouth America remains.

Yancoal remains committed to proactively improving\nthe systems and processes employed across sites to educate,\ncommunicate and record employee safety initiatives.\n\n\nUnder the direction of the Health, Safety and Environment Committee,\nYancoal continues to build the leadership, capabilities, systems and\nreporting procedures required to deliver on its objectives of achieving\nzero harm at its operations.\n\n\n**Financial performance**\nYancoal achieved a total operating EBIT of $732 million before tax, up\n$693 million on the year prior.\n\n\nYancoal’s financial improvement is directly attributable to the strategic\nacquisition of 100% of Coal & Allied Industries Limited (“Coal & Allied”)\nfrom Rio Tinto for US$2.69 billion in value, as at 1 September 2017,\n\n\n\nresulting in a significant increase in production output at a time of\nglobal coal market price improvements.\n\n\nIncreased production output at a time of industry-high benchmark\nprices for semi-soft coking and thermal coals led Yancoal’s recovery to\nannounce a profit after tax of $229 million from revenue of $2.6 billion\n(before tax) for the full year ended 31 December 2017.\n\n\nYancoal conducted a pro-rata renounceable entitlement offer\n(“Entitlement Offer”) of 23,464,929,520 fully paid ordinary shares to\nraise US$2.35 billion, and an associated placement of 1,500,000,000\nfully paid ordinary shares (“the Placement”) to raise a further\nUS$150 million, to support the funding of the Coal & Allied acquisition.\n\n\nYancoal maximised sales volumes and new blending opportunities\nacross assets, benefitting from a full quarter’s attributable production\nfrom the acquired Coal & Allied assets, post-completion in\nSeptember 2017.\n\n\nPost-acquisition earnings enabled the Company to recover both\nstamp duty and transaction costs, with Yancoal subsequently paying\ndown US$150 million in loans to Bank of China.\n\n\nThroughout 2017, Yancoal continued to implement cost reduction\nstrategies across all operations, addressed existing take-or-pay\narrangements, and blended products across the New South\nWales operations (both managed and operated) to meet new\nmarket opportunities.\n\n\n**Corporate activities**\nOn 1 September 2017, Yancoal became Australia’s largest pureplay coal producer, effectively doubling its production output and\nincreasing its coal product offerings via the completion of the strategic\nacquisition of 100% of Coal & Allied Industries Limited (“Coal & Allied”)\nfrom Rio Tinto for US$2.69 billion in value.\n\n\nCombining the world-class assets of Coal & Allied’s Mount Thorley\nWarkworth and Hunter Valley Operations with the Company’s existing\nportfolio, the acquisition enables the maximising of synergies between\nYancoal assets and supports the Company’s vision for continued\nmarket growth.\n\n\nYancoal’s binding agreement for US$2.69 billion in value comprised\nUS$2.45 billion cash payable on completion, US$240 million in future\nnon-contingent royalty payments over five years following completion,\nand a coal price linked contingent royalty.\n\n\nOn completion, the Company acquired the following interests in two\nof the country’s leading tier-one large-scale, long-life and low-cost\ncoal mines located in the Hunter Valley region of New South Wales, as\nwell as required export infrastructure:\n\n\n–– a 67.6% interest in the Hunter Valley Operations mining complex\n(“HVO”) [1] ;\n\n\n–– an 80.0% interest in the Mt Thorley mine and a 55.6% interest in\nthe Warkworth mine (together, “MTW”); and\n\n\n–– a 36.5% interest in Port Waratah Coal Services (“PWCS”), a coal\nexport terminal located at the Port of Newcastle.\n\n\nOn 27 July 2017, Yancoal entered into a binding agreement to\nestablish a 51:49 unincorporated joint venture with Glencore Coal Pty\nLtd (“Glencore”) in relation to Hunter Valley Operations (“HVO JV”),\nfollowing completion of Yancoal’s acquisition of Coal & Allied.\n\n\n\n1 Yancoal’s interest in HVO will reduce to 51% on completion of the Glencore Transaction. Completion of the Glencore Transaction is subject to a number of conditions\nprecedent that have not been satisfied as at the date of this announcement.\n\n\nThe joint venture arrangement provides significant combined synergies\nand commercial opportunities for both Yancoal and Glencore, with\nshareholders set to benefit from the co-operative management\nexperience and operational skills of two of Australia’s leading coal\nproducers. The HVO JV remains subject to Glencore achieving all\nrequired approvals.\n\n\nUnder the terms of the Joint Venture Agreement, Glencore will pay\ncash consideration of US$1,139 million for 49% of HVO, of which\nUS$710 million will be paid to Mitsubishi Development Pty Ltd\n(“MDP”) and US$429 million paid to Yancoal, plus a 27.9% share\nof US$240 million of non-contingent royalties and 49% of HVO\ncontingent royalties payable by Yancoal in respect of the Coal &\nAllied acquisition.\n\n\nThe HVO JV will be jointly controlled by Yancoal and Glencore through\na Joint Venture Management Committee (“JVMC”), and managed by\nan independent management team to be appointed by the JVMC.\n\n\nYancoal will be appointed as the exclusive marketing representative\nfor sales of HVO JV coal products in China, Taiwan (other than for\ncertain specified customers), Thailand and Malaysia.\n\n\nAs published on the Australian Securities Exchange (“ASX”) 2 August\n2017, Yancoal conducted a pro-rata renounceable Entitlement Offer\nof 23,464,929,520 fully paid ordinary shares to raise US$2.35 billion,\nand an associated placement of 1,500,000,000 fully paid ordinary\nshares to raise a further US$150 million, to support the funding of the\nCoal & Allied acquisition.\n\n\nYancoal completed the issue of new fully paid ordinary shares\n(“New Shares”) via the Entitlement Offer and the Placement on 31\nAugust 2017.\n\n\nIn addition, Yancoal issued 18,000,031,000 New Shares to Yanzhou\non conversion of all of its Subordinated Capital Notes (“SCN”) and\nalso issued a further 150,943 New Shares on conversion of 80 other\nSCNs for which a conversion notice was received, in accordance with\nthe SCN terms of issue.\n\n\nThe Company also secured commitments from Taizhong and General\nNice to subscribe for US$100 million and US$50 million respectively\nand US$150 million in aggregate of new shares under the Placement.\n\n\nThe number of Yancoal shares on issue following the issue of the New\nShares under the Entitlement Offer, Placement and SCN conversion is\n43,959,388,122, as at 31 December 2017.\n\n\nNew Shares issued under the Entitlement Offer, Placement and SCN\nconversion commenced trading on the ASX on a normal settlement\nbasis on Friday, 1 September 2017.\n\n\n**Mining operations (all figures reported on a 100% basis)**\nThe addition of attributable production from the newly acquired Mount\nThorley Warkworth and Hunter Valley Operations mines generated\nan immediate and significant increase in production, achieving total\nsaleable coal production of 31.5Mt (23.4Mt equity basis) for the year\n(31 December 2016: 16.0Mt equity share) and total Run of Mine\n(“ROM”) coal production of 41.1Mt (30.6Mt equity share) for the year\n(31 December 2016: 21.2Mt equity share).\n\n\nYancoal achieved total coal sales (equity share) of 28.5Mt for the year\n(31 December 2016: 19.3Mt), with a sales split (equity share) for the\nperiod of 19.6Mt (2016 11.6Mt) thermal and 8.99Mt (2016 7.7Mt)\nmetallurgical coal.\n\n\n\n**DIRECTORS’ REPORT** ANNUAL REPORT **2017** **43**\n\n\nYancoal continued to manage the Cameby Downs and Premier coal\nmining operations in Queensland and Western Australia respectively,\non behalf of its majority shareholder Yanzhou Coal Mining Company\nLimited (“Yanzhou”) throughout the reporting period.

Remuneration principles and framework**\nThe Company’s governing principles for remuneration are:\n\n\n–– to ensure remuneration is equitable, aligned with the long-term interests of the Company and its shareholders and complies with relevant\nCompany policies, including the Diversity Policy;\n\n\n–– to provide market competitive remuneration and conditions to attract and retain skilled and motivated employees;\n\n\n–– to structure incentives to link reward with the achievement of the Company’s strategies and challenging business objectives and to the\ndelivery of sustainable returns over the long term; and\n\n\n–– to reward based on performance, in particular acknowledging the contribution of outstanding performers.\n\n\n2.1 Remuneration governance framework\nConsistent with its Board Charter, the Board oversees the appointment, remuneration and performance of all Key Management Personnel\n(“KMP”) other than Directors and other members of the Executive Committee. On these issues, the Board receives recommendations from the\nNomination and Remuneration Committee.\n\n\nThe Nomination and Remuneration Committee’s objective is to assist the Board by making recommendations in relation to:\n\n\n–– Board composition and succession planning for the Board;\n\n\n–– remuneration levels and structure for KMP, and other members of the Executive Committee as appointed from time to time;\n\n\n–– the public reporting of remuneration for KMP, and other members of the Executive Committee;\n\n\n–– the performance assessment of the Executive Committee;\n\n\n–– designing Company remuneration policy and regulations with regard to corporate governance; and\n\n\n–– diversity.\n\n\n**3. Executive remuneration**\nThe Executive remuneration structure below is an appropriate reflection of Yanzhou’s majority shareholding in the Company.\n\n\n3.1 Objective\nRemuneration frameworks for Executives are structured to be market competitive and to reflect the reward strategy of the organisation. Through\nthese frameworks the Company seeks to align remuneration for Executives with:\n\n\nShareholders’ interests by:\n\n\n–– making economic performance a core component of the overall remuneration plan design;\n\n\n–– focusing on the key value drivers of the business including employee safety, operational performance and cost control; and\n\n\n–– attracting and retaining high calibre executives.\n\n\nExecutive’s interests by:\n\n\n–– rewarding capability and experience;\n\n–– reflecting competitive reward for contribution to growth in company performance;\n\n\n–– providing a clear structure for earning rewards; and\n\n\n–– providing recognition for contribution.\n\n\nDetails of remuneration for all Executives are set out in Table 10 (See Section 4: Remuneration tables).\n\n\n3.2 Structure\nAll remuneration frameworks for Executives are structured as a combination of fixed and variable remuneration, as follows:\n\n\nTABLE 2: Executive remuneration structure\n\n\n**Current**\n\n**Fixed remuneration** –– Fixed Annual Remuneration (“FAR”), including cash salary, superannuation, and may include car allowance;\nand\n\n\n\n–– Other benefits (see Section 3.4).\n\n**Variable remuneration** ––\n(‘at risk’)\n\n\n\n–– Short-term Incentive (see Section 3.5.1),\n\n\n\n–– One-off Special Incentive Schemes to reward specific major strategic accomplishments (see Section 3.5.2 to\n3.5.4), and\n\n\n\n–– Long-term Incentive (see Section 3.5.5).\n\n\nIt had been intended to review the Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTI Plan”) during 2017, however due to more pressing priorities the review has\nnow been scheduled Q2 2018 as outlined at the beginning of this report.\n\n\n**DIRECTORS’ REPORT** ANNUAL REPORT **2017** **55**\n\n\n3.3 Remuneration mix\nThe relative proportion of remuneration entitlement for Executives that is fixed (excluding benefits) and that which is linked to individual or\nCompany performance or both (referred to as ‘at risk’) is as follows:\n\n\nTABLE 3: Proportion of Executives’ remuneration for 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|Fixed RemunerationA<br>Name 2017 2016 2015|At risk – Short TermB|At risk – Long term<br>Incentive PlanC|At risk – Special<br>Incentive SchemeD|Transaction<br>BonusE|SIS<br>Breakeven<br>BonusF|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|**Name**<br>**Fixed RemunerationA**<br>**2017**<br>**2016**<br>**2015**|**2017**<br>**2016**<br>**2015**|**2017**<br>**2016**<br>**2015**|**2017**<br>**2016**<br>**2015**|**2017**|**2017**|\n|Reinhold Schmidt<br>17%<br>24%<br>28%<br>Lei Zhang<br>29%<br>52%<br>53%<br>Baocai Zhang<br>22%<br>50%<br>47%|21%<br>29%<br>30%<br>13%<br>27%<br>22%<br>28%<br>37%<br>35%|25%<br>37%<br>31%<br>4%<br>5%<br>5%<br>0%<br>NA<br>NA|6%<br>10%<br>11%<br>8%<br>16%<br>20%<br>8%<br>13%<br>18%|22%<br>36%<br>28%|9%<br>10%<br>14%|\n\n\nBoyun Xu was an Executive Director of Yancoal up until 28 April 2017, however his executive role related to Yancoal International (Holding) Co. Ltd (“YIH”). Mr Xu’s remuneration\nis paid for by YIH and as such he is not considered a senior executive of Yancoal.\n\nA Calculations for fixed remuneration entitlement include benefits but excluding the value of expatriate benefits, see table 3 and table 10.\nB The short term variable remuneration entitlement is determined pursuant to the Short Term Incentive Plan (outlined in section 3.5.1).\nC The Long Term Incentive Plan is outlined in section 3.5.5\nD The Special Incentive Scheme is outlined in section 3.5.2\n\nE Transaction Bonus is outlined in section 3.5.4\n\nF SIS Breakeven Bonus is outlined in section 3.5.3\n\n\n3.4 Fixed Remuneration\nExecutives receive a Fixed Remuneration package, which incorporates cash salary, superannuation benefits and may include a provision for a\ncar allowance, together with certain other benefits. Executives have some scope to determine the combination of cash (including car allowance)\nand certain non-monetary benefits by which their FAR is delivered, provided that it does not create undue cost for the Company.\n\n\nEach Senior Executive’s’ level of fixed remuneration is reviewed annually to provide a base level of remuneration which is appropriate to the\nposition and competitive with companies in a similar industry referencing remuneration data from McDonald and Company (Australasia) Pty Ltd\n(“McDonald Report”). No Executives are guaranteed an annual increase in FAR.\n\n\nExecutives have some scope to determine the combination of cash (including car allowance) and certain non-monetary benefits by which their\nFAR is delivered, provided that it does not create undue cost for the Company.\n\n\n3.5 Variable remuneration\n\nVariable remuneration is delivered through participation in the STI Plan (as outlined in section 3.5.1) and a Special Incentive Scheme (as outlined\nin section 3.5.2). Certain Executives are also eligible to participate in a LTI Plan (as outlined in section 3.5.5).\n\n\n**3.5.1 Short Term Incentive Plan**\n\n\n_Eligibility_\nThe STI Plan applies to Executives as well as to the broader management and employees of the Company.\n\n\n_Objective_\nThe objective of the STI Plan is to reward Executives and employees for the achievements of the Company, Business Unit and individual goals\nthat are aligned to the Company’s financial, operational and strategic priorities.\n\n\n_Structure_\n\nFor 2017 the STI Plan comprised three key components:\n\n\n1. **STI opportunity** – this is expressed as a percentage of the Executive’s FAR. The STI opportunity is reviewed annually. A benchmarking\nexercise is completed against comparable peers in listed companies, and no changes were proposed for 2017. The CEO and CEC have\nan agreed STI opportunity of between a minimum of 0% and a maximum of 126% of FAR for 2017. The Board believes this level of STI\nopportunity is reasonable and competitive for the current environment.\n\n\n2. **STI Scorecard** – this consists of a number of Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”). For the Executives named in this report, all KPIs are\nmeasured at the Company level. The KPIs fall into the following categories TRIFR (Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate) (25% weighting),\nEnvironment (10% weighting), FOR (Free On Rail) Cash Costs (35% weighting), Profitability (20% weighting) and Specific Business Unit\nMeasures (10%). Details of how the STI Scorecard is evaluated are set out below. STI scorecard performance is assessed by the Chairman\nof the Executive Committee and the Chief Executive Officer, reviewed by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, and approved by\nthe Board.\n\n\n3. **Individual Performance** – this is measured by Key Result Areas (“KRA”). These KRAs are aligned to the Executive’s role and include areas\nsuch as special projects, achievement of operating and capital expenditure budgets, and achievement of growth/continuous improvement\ninitiatives. Based on performance against the KRAs, the Executive receives a performance rating at the end of the year on a scale from\nExceptional to Below Standard. In the case of the Chief Executive Officer, individual performance is assessed by the Nomination and\nRemuneration Committee, to be endorsed by the Board. For all other Executives, performance is assessed by the Chief Executive Officer and\nthe Chair of the Executive Committee.\n\n\n**56** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\n\n\n**DIRECTORS’ REPORT (CONTINUED)**\n\n\nAt the start of each year, KPIs and KRAs are reviewed and selected by Board as being the most appropriate to the business. Assessment\nagainst these measures is determined following the end of each year.\n\n\nPerformance against the STI Scorecard and the Individual KRAs are converted to two payout multipliers, and applied to the Target\nSTI opportunity to determine the actual STI award. Accordingly, the Executive’s STI award is heavily influenced by the achievement of\nCompany KPIs.\n\n\n**Further detail on the STI Scorecard – 2017**\nThe STI Scorecard measures the Company’s performance in respect of Profitability, Health, Safety and Environment and Specific Business\nUnit measures.\n\n\n_2017 STI outcome_\n\nSTI outcomes are calculated by multiplying the target STI opportunity by the STI Scorecard payout multiplier and the individual performance\npayout multiplier.\n\n\nAny STI award is delivered as a cash payment around April each year.\n\n\nTABLE 4: Company Performance against STI Scorecard in 2017\n\n\n**Actual performance**\n**STI scorecard category** **STI Scorecard** **STI Weighting** **against KPI**\nProfitability Profit Before Tax (“PBT”) 20% 118%\n\nFOR Cash Costs 35% 108%\n\nHSE TRIFR (Total recordable injury frequency rate) 25% 75%\n\nEnvironment 10% 174%\n\nBusiness Unit measures Two business unit measures customised to each Executive’s role 10% 188%\n\n\nThe assessed outcomes and average achievement for the company of 132% reflects the following achievements in 2017:\n\n(a) the overall delivery of Profit Before Tax for the Group (excluding Coal & Allied) and the assets managed on behalf of Yancoal International\nHoldings (“YIH”) of $246.6M ahead of budget; and\n\n\n(b) reductions in the key measure of FOR Cash Cost per ton across three out of six mine sites; and\n\n\n(c) the average achievement of 125% for each Business Unit measure; and\n\n\n(d) Environment measures include environmental complaints and incidents.\n\n\n**3.5.2 Special Incentive Scheme**\nAs reported in the 2015 Annual report this is a one off scheme for 2015 and is distributed to employees via three tranches; one third in Year 1,\none third in Year 2 and one third in Year 3.

Consistent with the Constitution,\nremuneration payable to each Non-Executive Director has been approved by the Company’s majority shareholder, Yanzhou.\n\n\nThe total Board and Committee fees paid by the Company to Non-Executive Directors in 2017, excluding payments for extra services outlined\nbelow, was $666,645 which is $2,833,355 below the current aggregate cap of $3,500,000 per annum.\n\n\nDuring 2017, Non-Executive Directors were remunerated by way of fixed fees in the form of cash and superannuation (to the maximum\nsuperannuation guarantee cap). There has been no change to the Board and Committee fees from 2016 to 2017. No equity instruments were\nissued to Non-Executive Directors over 2017 as part of their remuneration package. No element of the Non-Executive Director fees are linked\nto performance.\n\n\nNeither Board nor Committee fees were paid to nominee Directors of Yanzhou (Xiyong Li, Cunliang Lai, Yuxiang Wu, Fuqi Wang, Baocai\nZhang, Qingchun Zhao and Xiangqian Wu) as the responsibilities of Board or Committee membership were considered part of their role and\nremuneration arrangements with their nominating company. William Randall and Xing Feng were not paid any Board or Committee fees.\n\n\nNeither Board nor Committee fees were paid to Executive Directors (Baocai Zhang or Boyun Xu) as the responsibilities of Committee\nmembership are considered in determining the remuneration provided as part of their normal employment conditions.\n\n\nTABLE 12: Board and Committee fees\n\n\n**2017**\n**$**\n\n**Board Fees per annum (including any superannuation)**\nChairman of the Board Not applicable\nCo-Vice Chairman of the Board 115,000 [A]\n\nDirector 150,000 [B]\n\n\n**Committee Fees per annum (including any superannuation)**\nAudit and Risk Management Committee – Chair 30,000\nAudit and Risk Management Committee – member 15,000\nHealth, Safety and Environment Committee – Chair 30,000\n\nHealth, Safety and Environment Committee – member 15,000\n\nNomination and Remuneration Committee – Chair Not applicable\n\nNomination and Remuneration Committee – member Not applicable\nStrategy and Development Committee – Chair Not applicable\nStrategy and Development Committee – member 15,000\n\n\nA Not paid to Yanzhou appointed Co-Vice Chairman\n\n\nB Other than as noted in Table 13\n\n\n**Transaction specific remuneration**\nIn 2017 the Company made total payments of $622,170 ($70,055 in 2016) for the extra services provided by the Non-Executive Directors\nGregory Fletcher, Geoffrey Raby, Huaqiao Zhang and Vincent O’Rourke for their contribution to undertake investigations and discussions on\nbehalf of the Company to consider the acquisition from Rio Tinto of the remaining Coal & Allied coal assets held by Rio Tinto being, principally,\nRio Tinto’s interest in the Hunter Valley Operations mine and the Mount Thorley Warkworth mines.\n\n\nDetails of remuneration for all Non-Executive Directors are set out in Table 13 (see Section 6: Remuneration tables).\n\n\nTable 13 sets out the details of remuneration (in the form of Board and Committee fees and other benefits) earned by Non-Executive Directors,\ncalculated in accordance with applicable Accounting Standards.\n\n\n**DIRECTORS’ REPORT** ANNUAL REPORT **2017** **61**\n\n\nTABLE 13: Details of Non-Executive Directors’ Remuneration, earned in 2016 and 2017\n\n\n**Short Term Benefits** **Post-Employment Benefits**\n\n\n\n**Non-** **Long**\n**Monetary** **Service**\n\n**Name** **Year** **Fees** **STI or Bonus** **Benefits** **Superannuation** **Leave** **Total**\n\n\nXiyong Li **2017** **Nil** **Nil** **Nil** **Nil** **Nil** **Nil**\n\n2016 Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil\n\nHuaqiao Zhang **2017** **102,492** **[B]** **Nil** **Nil** **9,737** **Nil** **112,229**\n2016 94,273 [C] Nil Nil 8,956 Nil 103,229\n\nCunliang Lai **2017** **Nil** **Nil** **Nil** **Nil** **Nil** **Nil**\n\n2016 Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil\n\nYuxiang Wu **2017** **Nil** **Nil** **Nil** **Nil** **Nil** **Nil**\n\n2016 Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil\n\nWilliam Randall **2017** **Nil** **Nil** **Nil** **Nil** **Nil** **Nil**\n\n2016 Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil\n\nXinghua Ni **2017** **Nil** **Nil** **Nil** **Nil** **Nil** **Nil**\n\n2016 Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil\n\nFuqi Wang **2017** **Nil** **Nil** **Nil** **Nil** **Nil** **Nil**\n\n2016 Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil Nil\n\nGregory Fletcher **2017** **569,089** **[D]** **Nil** **Nil** **38,585** **Nil** **607,674**\n2016 214,453 [E] Nil Nil 20,373 Nil 234,826\n\nGeoffrey Raby **2017** **267,138** **[F]** **Nil** **Nil** **15,688** **Nil** **282,826**\n2016 174,138 [G] Nil Nil 15,688 Nil 189,826\n\nVincent O’Rourke **2017** **270,138** **[H]** **Nil** **Nil** **15,688** **Nil** **285,826**\n\n2016 174,138 [I] Nil Nil 15,688 Nil 189,826\n\nTotal **2017** **1,208,857** **Nil** **Nil** **79,698** **Nil** **1,288,555**\n\n2016 657,002 Nil Nil 60,705 Nil 717,707\n\n\n\n**Name**\n\n\n\n**Year** **Fees** **STI or Bonus** **Su** **erannuation** **Leave** **Total**\n\n\n\n**Non-**\n\n**Monetary**\n**Benefits** **Superannuation**\n\n\n\nIncludes following transaction specific remuneration paid:\n\n\nB, C Huaqiao Zhang – 2017: $10,959, 2016: $2,740\n\n\nD, E Gregory Fletcher – 2017: $403,951, 2016: $49,315\n\n\nF, G Geoffrey Raby – 2017: $102,000, 2016: $9,000\n\n\nH, I Vincent O’Rourke – 2017: $105,000, 2016: $9,000\n\n\n**7.

The Independent\nBoard Committee was constituted two times in 2017 for the purposes\nof considering transactions between or involving the Company and\nits major shareholder, Yanzhou. In each case, the Independent Board\nCommittee comprised at least three independent directors.\n\n\nOther committees may be established by the Board as and\nwhen required.\n\n\nMembership of the Board committees is based on the needs of\nthe Company, relevant regulatory requirements, and the skills and\nexperience of individual directors.\n\n\nDirector independence\nThe Board comprises 11 directors, of whom 5 hold their positions in\nan independent non-executive capacity (based on the _independence_\n_standard_ disclosed below). The Company’s current independent\ndirectors are Geoffrey Raby, Gregory Fletcher, David Moult\n(appointed 30 January 2018), Helen Gillies (appointed 30 January\n2018) and Xing Feng (appointed 15 December 2017). During their\nappointment, Messrs William Randall (resigned 9 November 2017)\nand Vincent O’Rourke AM (resigned 30 January 2018) and Huaqiao\nZhang (resigned 30 January 2018) were each deemed to be\nindependent directors.\n\n\nThe Board has assessed the independence of each of the NonExecutive Directors (including the Chairman) in light of their interests\nand relationships. A majority of the Board are not considered\nindependent directors having regard to their affiliation with the\nCompany’s major shareholder, Yanzhou, and accordingly the\nCompany does not comply with Recommendation 2.4 of the ASX\nRecommendation. However, the Board considers that its composition\nappropriately represents the interests of its shareholders including\nits major shareholder, Yanzhou, and that the Board has put in place\nappropriate policies and procedures to guide the Board and senior\nexecutives in circumstances where conflicts of interest may arise and\nin its dealings with Yanzhou, including establishing the Independent\nBoard Committee referred to above.\n\n\nTo help ensure that any conflicts of interests are identified, the\nCompany has put in place a standing agenda item at all meetings\nof the Board and its committees to provide the directors with the\nopportunity of declaring any conflicts of interests in the subject matter\nof the proposed resolutions made within the meeting.\n\n\nTo assist the Board in making independent judgements, the Board\nCharter sets out the procedure by which the Board collectively, and\neach individual director, can seek independent professional advice,\nat the Company’s expense.\n\n\nEach independent director must regularly provide the Board with\nall information relevant to their continued compliance with the\nindependence standard. The independence of directors will be\nreviewed by the Board on a regular basis with assistance from the\nNomination and Remuneration Committee. The Nomination and\nRemuneration Committee will also assist the Board with regular\nevaluation of the performance of the Board, Board committees and\nindividual directors.\n\n\n\n_Independence Standard_\nIn assessing the independence of its directors, the Board has regard\nto the factors relevant to assessing the independence of a director\nthat are set out in Box 2.3 of the ASX Recommendations (3rd edition).\nThe criteria considered in assessing the independence of NonExecutive Directors are also set out in the Board Charter.\n\n\nA director is considered independent if the director:\n\n\n–– is not, and has not within the last three years been, employed in an\nexecutive capacity by the Company or any of its child entities;\n\n\n–– is not, nor has within the last three years been, a partner, director\nor senior employee of a provider of material professional services\nto the Company or any of its child entities;\n\n\n–– is not, nor has within the last three years been, in a material\nbusiness relationship with the Company or any of its child entities,\nor an officer of, or otherwise associated with, someone with such\na relationship;\n\n–– is not a substantial Shareholder of the Company or an officer\nof, or otherwise associated with, a substantial Shareholder of\nthe Company;\n\n\n–– does not have a material contractual relationship with the\nCompany or any of its child entities other than as a director;\n\n\n–– does not have close family ties with any person who falls within any\nof the categories described above;\n\n\n–– has not been a director of the Company for such a period that his\nor her independence may have been compromised; and\n\n\n–– is free from any other interest, position, association or relationship\nthat might interfere, or might reasonably be seen to interfere, with\nthe director’s capacity to bring an independent judgement to bear\non issues before the Board and to act in the best interests of the\nCompany and its shareholders generally.\n\n\nThe Company’s Constitution provides that the Company’s\nshareholders holding a majority of the issued shares of the Company\n(which confer the right to vote) may nominate a director to the office\nof Chairman and may elect one or more directors to the office of\nVice Chair.\n\n\nAlthough as a nominee of Yanzhou, Xiyong Li, the Chairman is not\nconsidered independent by the independence standard (as above),\nthe Board considers that this is an appropriate reflection of Yanzhou’s\nmajority shareholding in the Company. While a majority of the directors\nare associated with Yanzhou this is considered appropriate in light of\nYanzhou’s major shareholding in the Company.\n\n\nXing Feng is employed by China Cinda Asset Management, an\nassociate of Cinda International HGB Investment (UK) Limited\n(a substantial shareholder of the Company). The Board considers that\nthis relationship does not materially interfere with, nor is perceived to\ninterfere with, the independent exercise of Mr Feng’s judgement and\nthat he is able to fulfil the role of independent director for the purpose\nof the ASX Recommendations. Accordingly, the Board considers\nMr Feng to be an independent Non-Executive Director. Where\nappropriate, Mr Feng will stand aside from decision making where\nconflicts of interest may arise, and does not participate in Independent\nBoard Committees.\n\n\nBoard skills matrix\n\nThe table below sets out the skills and experience that are currently\nrepresented on the Board.\n\n\n**Skills and Experiences** **Total**\n\nMining/exploration and production 5\n\nEngineering 5\nCapital projects 9\nTrading/marketing 4\nStrategy 11\n\nLeadership 11\n\nBoard/Committee experience 9\nCorporate governance 8\nAccounting/audit/risk management 7\nGovernment/policy 9\nLegal/regulatory 5\n\nHealth, safety and environment 7\n\nHuman resources 6\n\nInternational business expertise 10\n\n\nInduction and professional development\nUpon appointment, directors are provided with an information\npack containing a letter of appointment setting out the Company’s\nexpectations, directors’ duties and the terms and conditions of their\nappointment, and other materials containing information about the\nCompany including the Company’s Constitution, charters and policies\nto support the induction of directors to the Board.\n\n\nDirectors also participate in continuing education or development\nprograms arranged for them, including for example training on\ndirector’s duties and developments in workplace health and\nsafety law.\n\n\nThe Company Secretary supports directors by providing access to\ninformation in appropriate form where requested.\n\n\n**Principle 3: Act ethically and responsibly**\n\nConduct and ethics\n\nThe Board policy is that directors, employees and contractors must\nobserve both the letter and spirit of the law, and adhere to the\nhighest standards of business conduct. The Company has adopted a\nformal Code of Conduct and other guidelines and policies which are\napproved by the Board that set out legal and ethical standards for the\nCompany’s directors and employees, including a Conflicts of Interests\nand Related Party Transactions Policy.\n\n\nThe Code of Conduct and these other guidelines and policies guide\nthe directors, the CEO, senior executives, and employees generally as\nto the practices necessary to maintain confidence in the Company’s\nintegrity and as to the responsibility and accountability of individuals\nfor reporting, and investigating reports of, unethical practices.\nThe Code of Conduct and these other guidelines and policies also\nguide compliance with legal and other obligations to stakeholders.\n\n\nSpecifically, the objective of the Code of Conduct is to:\n\n\n–– provide a benchmark for professional behaviour;\n\n\n–– support the Company’s business reputation and corporate image\nwithin the community; and\n\n\n–– make directors and employees aware of the consequences if they\nbreach the policy.\n\n\n\n**CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT** ANNUAL REPORT **2017** **71**\n\n\nThe key values underpinning the Code of Conduct are:\n\n\n–– our actions must be governed by the highest standards of integrity\nand fairness;\n\n\n–– our decisions must be made in accordance with the letter and\nspirit of applicable law; and\n\n\n–– our business must be conducted honestly and ethically, with\nour best skills and judgement, and for the benefit of customers,\nemployees, shareholders and the Company alike.\n\n\nThe Code of Conduct is available in the Corporate Governance\nsection of the Company’s website.\n\n\nReporting concerns and whistleblower protection\nThe Company’s Speak-Up Yancoal Ethics policy encourages\nemployees, directors, contractors and consultants to raise serious\nconcerns within the Company and report any issues if they genuinely\nbelieve a person has, or persons have, breached Yancoal’s Code of\nConduct, policies or the law. The policy also protects individuals who\nin good faith report misconduct which they reasonably believe to be\ncorrupt, illegal or unethical on a confidential basis, without fear of\nreprisal, dismissal or discriminatory treatment; and assists in ensuring\nthat matters of misconduct and/or unethical behaviour are identified\nand dealt with appropriately.\n\n\nIndividuals can report their concerns confidentially online, via\nconfidential email to an external facilitator or by telephoning a\nconfidential Speak Up Line.\n\n\nAll disclosures made under this policy will be treated seriously and be\nthe subject of a thorough investigation with the objective of locating\nevidence that either substantiates or refutes the misconduct disclosed\nby an employee. Such investigations will be facilitated independently\nfrom the business unit concerned, the employee who made the\ndisclosure or any person being the subject of the reportable conduct.\nThe Company will determine, based on the seriousness of the\ndisclosure, whether the investigation will be conducted internally by a\nsenior member of management or the external facilitator.\n\n\n**Principle 4: Safeguard integrity in corporate reporting**\nAudit and Risk Management Committee\nThe Board has established an Audit and Risk Management\nCommittee. The committee plays a key role in helping the Board to\noversee financial reporting, internal control structure, risk management\nsystems and internal and external audit functions. The committee has\nthe necessary power and resources to meet its responsibilities under\nits charter, including rights of access to management and auditors\n(internal and external) and to seek explanations and additional\ninformation. The committee meets at least four times per year, or as\nfrequently as required. The Charter of the Audit and Risk Management\nCommittee can be found in the Corporate Governance section of the\nCompany’s website. The purpose of the Audit and Risk Management\nCommittee is outlined under the Board committees section above.\n\n\nIn accordance with its Charter, the Audit and Risk Management\nCommittee has at least three members. The current members of this\ncommittee are Gregory Fletcher (chair of the committee), Qingchun\nZhao (appointed 17 May 2017) and Geoffrey Raby. Former Committee\nmember Yuxiang Wu resigned on 28 April 2017 meaning that for a\nbrief period, until Qingchun Zhao was appointed to the Committee by\nway of a circular resolution of the Board, the Committee had only two\nmembers. The Committee did not meet during this time and Qingchun\nZhao was appointed at the first available opportunity.\n\n\n**72** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\n\n\n**CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (CONTINUED)**\n\n\n\nThe committee consists only of Non-Executive Directors\nwith a majority being independent. Consistent with the ASX\nRecommendations, the chair of the committee is an independent\nNon-Executive Director and is not the Chairman of the Board. The\nqualifications, skills and experience of each member is disclosed in\nthe Information on directors in the Directors’ Report, on page 45.\n\n\nThe Company has also employed a full time EGM of Risk\nManagement and Auditing. His role is described further under\nPrinciple 7.\n\n\nCEO and CFO certifications on financial reports\nThe CEO and CFO have declared in writing to the Board that in\nrespect of the half year ended 30 June 2017 and the full year\nended 31 December 2017, in their opinion, the financial records\nof the Company have been properly maintained and the financial\nstatements comply with the appropriate accounting standards and\ngive a true and fair view of the financial position and performance of\nthe Company, and that their opinion has been formed on the basis\nof a sound system of risk management and internal control which is\noperating effectively.\n\n\nExternal Auditor\n\nThe Company’s external auditor is ShineWing Australia. Consistent\nwith the requirements of the _Corporations Act 2001_ (Cth), ShineWing\nAustralia has a policy of partner rotation every five years. The\nappointment, removal and remuneration (not including amounts paid\nfor special or additional services provided by the auditor) of the auditor\nrequire shareholder approval.\n\n\nThe external auditor receives all papers and minutes of the Audit\nand Risk Management Committee. The external auditor also attends\nthe Company’s Annual General Meeting to answer questions from\nshareholders relevant to the Company’s audit.\n\n\n**Principle 5: Make timely and balanced disclosure**\nThe Company recognises the importance of timely and adequate\ndisclosure to the market, and is committed to making timely\nand balanced disclosure of all material matters and to effective\ncommunication with its shareholders and investors so as to give\nthem ready access to balanced and understandable information. The\nCompany also works together with its major shareholder, Yanzhou,\nto ensure that Yanzhou can comply with its disclosure obligations in\nrelation to Company information, and vice versa, Yanzhou seeks to\nensure that the Company can comply with its disclosure obligations in\nrelation to Yanzhou’s information.\n\n\nThe Board has put in place a Disclosure Policy to encapsulate the\ndisclosure obligations under the _Corporations Act 2001_ and the ASX\nListing Rules and to set out procedures for managing compliance\nwith those obligations. These procedures provide a framework for\nmanaging the disclosure of material matters to the market to ensure\naccountability at Board and senior executive level. As part of this\nframework, a standing agenda item at all the Company’s Board and\nExecutive Committee meetings requires the directors and senior\nexecutive to consider whether any matters at the meeting should be\ndisclosed to the market. The Disclosure Policy can be found within the\nCorporate Governance section of the Company’s website.\n\n\nA Disclosure Committee has been established to assist the Company\nto meet its disclosure obligations. The Committee plays a key role\nin reviewing and determining whether information is likely to have a\nmaterial effect on the price or value of the Company’s securities such\nthat it requires disclosure to the market. The Disclosure Committee\nmembers comprise the CEC, CEO, CFO, Company Secretary,\nInvestor Relations General Manager and Group Counsel.\n\n\n\nAny information disclosed to the market through an announcement\nto the ASX is also published on the Investor section of the\nCompany’s website.\n\n\n**Principle 6: Respect the rights of shareholders**\n\nCommunications with shareholders\n\nThe Company has an investor relations program that is aimed at\nfacilitating two-way communications with investors. The Company’s\npolicy is to promote effective communication with shareholders\nand other investors so that they understand how to assess relevant\ninformation about the Company and its corporate direction. The\nCompany aims to keep shareholders, potential investors and\nother stakeholders informed of all major developments affecting\nthe state of affairs of the Company. The Company communicates\ninformation regularly to shareholders, potential investors and other\nstakeholders by:\n\n\n–– posting announcements on the ASX platform in accordance\nwith its continuous disclosure obligations and also making these\nannouncements available on the Company’s website;\n\n\n–– keeping its website up to date on important information about the\nCompany, including its Constitution, Board and Board Committee\nCharters, core corporate governance policies and financial\ninformation about the Company; and\n\n\n–– publishing investor presentations made to analysts and\nmedia briefings available within the Investor section of the\nCompany’s website.\n\n\nThe Company encourages shareholders to attend and participate in\nall general meetings including annual general meetings. Shareholders\nare entitled to ask questions about the management of the Company\nand of the auditor as to its conduct of the audit and preparation of its\nreports. Any shareholders who cannot attend any general meetings\ncan also participate via lodgement of their proxies. In addition,\nshareholders have the option of receiving communications from and\nsending communications to the Company and the Company’s share\nregistry, Computershare Investor Services, electronically.\n\n\nThe Company’s Shareholder Communication Policy which was\napproved by the Board, can be found within the Corporate\nGovernance section of the Company’s website.\n\n\n**Principle 7: Recognise and manage risk**\nRisk identification and management\nThe Board, through the Audit and Risk Management Committee, is\nresponsible for satisfying itself that a sound system of risk oversight\nand management exists and that internal controls are effective. In\nparticular, the Board ensures that:\n\n–– the principal strategic, operational, financial reporting and\ncompliance risks are identified; and\n\n\n–– systems are in place to assess, manage, monitor and report on\nthese risks.\n\n\nThe role and membership of the Audit and Risk Management\nCommittee are described under Principles 2 and 4.\n\n\nThe Company’s Audit and Risk Management Committee Charter\ncan be found within the Corporate Governance section of the\nCompany’s website.\n\n\nThe Board has requested the Company’s senior executives\nand management to report to the Audit and Risk Management\nCommittee and, where appropriate the Board, regarding the effective\nmanagement of its material business risks.\n\n\nIn 2017, the Audit and Risk Management Committee had in place\na framework to identify and manage material business risks. This\nframework includes:\n\n–– identification of material business risk by the Executive Committee\nby reference to a single risk register, approved by the Audit and\nRisk Management Committee and Board;\n\n\n–– implementation of a risk management framework (that includes\na risk management policy, governance structure, procedures),\napproved by the Audit and Risk Management Committee\nand Board;\n\n–– formal risk identification activities being undertaken at both a\nfunctional level and at each of the Company’s mine sites;\n\n\n–– designated individuals across the business that have accountability\nfor the implementation of risk management within their areas\nof responsibility;\n\n\n–– the EGM of Risk Management and Auditing as a central resource\navailable to assist with all risk management responsibilities, and to\nassist with any training/awareness or other related requirements;\nand\n\n\n–– adherence to internal procedures and plans for crisis management.\n\n\nThe Audit and Risk Management Committee receives periodic reports\non the performance of the Company’s risk management framework,\nas well as on the Company’s key risk exposures to satisfy itself that it\ncontinues to be sound. A review of the risk management framework\nwas conducted in 2017.\n\n\nFormal risk identification activities are undertaken on an annual basis\nas part of the 5-year Strategic Planning Process undertaken each\nyear; with Risk Identification and Analysis undertaken at a functional\nlevel, as well as at each of the organisation’s mine sites. In addition,\nwhere appropriate, project specific risk assessments are conducted.\n\n\nThe EGM of Risk Management and Auditing is responsible for\nestablishing and managing the company wide risk management\nsystem, risk management framework and practices, reviewing the\nimpact of the risk management framework on its control environment\nand insurance arrangements and reviewing the risk of major\ninvestment projects. Together with the CEC, the Board and the Audit\nand Risk Management Committee, the EGM of Risk Management\nand Auditing is responsible for developing a risk matrix and framework\nand for implementing related risk assurance processes and audits of\ncompliance for the Company and its subsidiaries.\n\n\nThe responsibility for managing risks, risk controls or risk management\naction plans is embedded within the business and undertaken as part\nof everyday activities.\n\n\nRisks associated with the Company\nThe future operating performance of the Group may be affected by\nrisks relating to the Company’s business. Some of these risks are\nspecific to the Company while others relate to economic conditions\nand the general industry and markets in which the Company operates.\n\n\nThe Company’s risk management policies and procedures have\nbeen designed and implemented to identify, manage and mitigate\nany exposure to risks relating to the Company’s business, including\neconomic, environmental and social sustainability risks. The Company\nundertakes regular monitoring and assessment of these risks and\nimplements risk mitigation strategies to minimise its exposure to such\nrisks. However, there can be no assurance that such risk mitigation\nstrategies will protect the Company from these risks. Other risks\nare beyond the Company’s control and cannot be mitigated.

Operational difficulties may impact the amount\nof coal produced, delay coal deliveries or increase the cost of mining\nfor a varying length of time. These operating risks include (but are\nnot limited to) industrial, mine collapses, cave-ins or other failures\nrelating to mine infrastructure, including tailings dams, interruptions\ndue to inclement or hazardous weather conditions, power interruption,\ncritical equipment failure (in particular any protracted breakdown\nor issues with any of the Company’s CHPP or a major excavator),\nfires, and explosions from methane gas or coal dust, accidental\nmine water discharges, flooding and variations in or unusual or\nunexpected geological or geotechnical mining conditions (particularly\nin the Company’s underground operations). Such risks could result\nin damage to applicable mines, personal injury, environmental\ndamage, delays in coal production, decreased coal production, loss\nof revenue, monetary losses and possible legal liability. Although the\nCompany’s insurance policies provide coverage for some of these\nrisks, the amount and scope of insurance cover is limited by market\nand economic factors and there can be no assurance that these risks\nwould be fully covered by insurances maintained by the Company.\n\n\n_Injury or accident risks_\nIf any injuries or accidents occur in a mine, this could have adverse\nfinancial implications including legal claims for personal injury, wrongful\ndeath, amendments to approvals, potential production delays or\nstoppages, any of which may have a material adverse effect on the\nfinancial performance and/or financial position of the Company.\n\n\n_Funding risks_\nThe amount of future funding required by the Company will depend\non a number of factors, including the performance of the Company’s\nbusiness at that time. The Company’s business operations and\ncashflow are highly sensitive to any fluctuation in the US$ coal price,\ncoal production from its operations, demand for its coal product and\nUS$ movement in foreign exchange rates, particularly movements in\nthe A$:US$ exchange rate.\n\n\nIn developing its business plan and operating budget, the Company\nhas made certain assumptions regarding coal prices, the A$:US$\nexchange rate, future production levels and other factors which\ndetermine the Company’s financial performance.\n\n\nIf a funding shortfall materialises, the Company may need to raise\nsubstantial additional debt or equity. The Company’s capacity to\nsecure the requisite level of funding will depend on the amount\nof funding required, the performance and future prospects of its\nbusiness and a number of other factors, including US$ coal prices,\ninterest rates, economic conditions, debt market conditions, equity\nmarket conditions, and future levels of Yanzhou support.\n\n\nTo the extent that the Company is not able to secure additional\nfinancing (whether debt or equity) on acceptable terms from third\nparties, the Company will continue to rely on financial support\nfrom Yanzhou.\n\n\nAs at 31 December 2017, the Company had a loan receivable from\nWatagan of A$712 million (re-drawable up to A$1.36 billion) which\nis subject to impairment testing. There is a guarantee provided\nby Yankuang (being the ultimate parent entity of the Company) to\nindemnify the Company for any amounts due and payable under the\nloan which are not paid by Watagan.\n\n\n\nYanzhou’s and Yankuang’s capacity to meet their respective funding\ncommitments will depend on their financial position at the time and\ntheir capacity to raise the necessary funds to meet the commitments.\nYancoal’s capacity to source further funding from Yanzhou will depend\non Yanzhou’s willingness and financial capacity to provide that\nfunding. There can be no assurance that Yanzhou will be in a position\nto provide financial support to Yancoal or that Yankuang will be in a\nposition to meet its obligations under the guarantee in respect of the\nWatagan Agreements.\n\n\n_Adverse foreign exchange rate movements_\nForeign exchange risk is the risk of the Company sustaining loss\nthrough adverse movements in exchange rates.\n\n\nSuch losses can impact the Company’s financial position and\nperformance and the level of additional funding required to support\nthe Company’s businesses.\n\n\nThe liabilities, earnings and cash flows of the Company are influenced\nby movements in exchange rates, especially movements in the\nA$:US$ exchange rate.\n\n\nWhile the Company operates entirely in Australia and its costs\nare primarily denominated in its functional currency, the A$,\nforeign currency exposure arises particularly in relation to coal\nsupply contracts, which generally are priced and payable in US$,\nprocurement of imported plant and equipment, which can be priced in\nUS$ or other foreign currencies, and debt denominated in US$.\n\n\nThe impact of exchange rate movements will vary depending\non factors such as the nature, magnitude and duration of the\nmovements, the extent to which currency risk is hedged under\nforward exchange contracts or other hedging instruments and the\nterms of these contracts.\n\n\nThe hedging policy of the Company aims to protect against\nthe volatility of cash expenditures or reduced collection in the\nabovementioned transactions as well as to reduce the volatility of\nprofit or loss for retranslation of US dollar denominated loans at each\nperiod end.\n\n\n_Hedging through bank issued instruments_\nOperating foreign exchange risk that arises from firm commitments\nor highly probable transactions is managed through the use of bank\nissued forward foreign currency contracts and collar option contracts.\nThe Company hedges a portion of contracted US dollar sales and\nasset purchases settled in foreign currencies in each currency to\nmitigate the adverse impact on cash flow due to the future rise or fall\nin Australian dollars against the relevant currencies.\n\n\n_Coal prices and coal demand risk_\nThe Company generates revenue from the sale of coal. In developing\nits business plan and operating budget, the Company makes certain\nassumptions regarding coal prices and demand for coal. The prices\nwhich the Company will receive for its coal depend on numerous\nmarket factors beyond its control and, accordingly, some underlying\ncoal price assumptions relied on by the Company may materially\nchange and actual coal prices and demand may differ materially from\nthose expected.\n\n\nThe prices for coal are determined predominantly by world markets,\nwhich are affected by numerous factors, including the outcome of\nfuture sale contract negotiations, general economic activity, industrial\nproduction levels, changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in\nenergy demand and demand for steel, changes in the supply of\nseaborne coal, technological changes, changes in production levels\n\n\nand events interfering with supply, changes in international freight\nrates or other transportation infrastructure and costs, the costs of\nother commodities and substitutes for coal, market changes in coal\nquality requirements, government regulations which restrict use of\ncoal, and tax impositions on the resources industry, all of which are\noutside the control of the Company and may have a material adverse\nimpact on coal prices and demand.\n\n\nIn addition, the coal price is highly dependent on the outlook for coal\nconsumption in large Asian economies, such as China, Japan and\nIndia, as well as any changes in government policy regarding coal or\nenergy policy in those countries.\n\n\nAbsent offsetting factors, significant and sustained adverse\nmovements in demand for coal and, consequently, coal prices (both\ngenerally and in relation to particular types and classes of coal) may\nhave a material adverse impact on the ongoing financial performance\nand financial position of the Company or may result in the Company\nnot proceeding with the development of new mines and projects due\nto such development not being economically viable.\n\n\nAny weakening in coal prices or any deterioration prompted by further\nreduction in demand or addition of new tonnes to the seaborne\nmarket (for example from thermal coal exports from the US) would\nhave a material adverse impact on the financial performance of the\nCompany and its capacity to undertake development projects.\n\n\n_Coal production risks_\nImprovement in the Company’s financial performance is dependent\non the Company being able to sustain or increase coal production\nand decrease operating costs on a per tonne basis. The Company’s\nsuccess or failure in improving productivity will become particularly\nimportant to the Company’s financial performance if the coal price\nremains at current levels or falls further.\n\n\nThe Company’s coal production can be impacted by a number\nof factors, including unforeseen geological or geotechnical issues\n(particularly in the Company’s underground operations), abnormal\nwet weather conditions (particularly in Queensland), unforeseen\ndelays or complexities in installing and operating mining longwall\nsystems, protracted breakdown of coal handling infrastructure and\nother mining equipment and rail and port breakdowns and outages.\nRegulatory factors and the occurrence of other operating risks can\nalso limit production.\n\n\n_Debt Costs_\n\nThe majority of the Company’s loans are US$ LIBOR based\nfloating rate loans and currently there are no interest rate hedging\narrangements in place. As a result, any increase in the US$ LIBOR\nfrom current levels will expose the Company to higher debt costs.\n\n\n_Taxation Risks_\n\nIn addition to the corporate income tax imposed on the Company,\nthe Company is required to pay government royalties, direct and\nindirect taxes and other imposts in the jurisdictions in which the\nCompany will operate. The Company may be affected by changes\nin government taxation and royalty policies or in the interpretation or\napplication of such policies under Australian laws.\n\n\nThe potential of the Company to obtain the benefit of existing\ntax losses and claim other tax attributes will depend on future\ncircumstances and may be affected by changes in ownership of\nboth Yanzhou and Yancoal, business activities, thin capitalisation\nthresholds, tax bases and any other conditions relating to the use\nof tax losses or other attributes of the group. The ability to use the\nCompany’s carried forward losses will depend on the Company’s\n\n\n\n**CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT** ANNUAL REPORT **2017** **75**\n\n\ncontinued satisfaction of the loss recoupment tests under Australian\ntax laws and be subject to the availability of sufficient future\ntaxable profits.\n\n\n_Australian Accounting Standards (AAS)_\nAAS are issued by the AASB and are beyond the control of\nthe Company and the Directors. Any changes to AAS or to the\ninterpretation of those standards may have an adverse effect on the\nreported financial performance or financial position of the Company.\n\n\nIn particular, the accounting treatment for transactions such as\nthe transfer of the NSW mining assets of Ashton, Austar and\nDonaldson to Watagan could be reviewed by standard setters\nand may be subject to change. In the event that the Company is\nrequired to reconsolidate Watagan’s results and financial position\ninto its consolidated financial statements ahead of the scheduled\ndate in 2025, due to a change to AAS or their interpretation, the\nreconsolidation may have an adverse effect on the reported financial\nperformance or financial position of the Company.\n\n\n_Regulatory approvals risks_\nThe ability of the Company to meet its long term production target\nprofile depends on (amongst other things) the Company being able\nto obtain on a timely basis, and maintain, all necessary regulatory\napprovals (including any approvals arising under applicable mining\nlaws, environmental regulations and other laws) for its current\noperations and expansion and growth projects, including obtaining\nplanning approvals, land access, land owner consents and addressing\nany native title issues, impacts on the environment and objections\nfrom local communities.\n\n\nThe requirement to obtain approvals and to address potential and\nactual issues for existing and future mining projects is common to\nall companies in the coal sector. However, there is no assurance\nor guarantee that the Company will be in a position to secure any\nor all of the required consents, approvals and rights necessary to\nmaintain its current production profile from its existing operations or to\ndevelop its growth projects in a manner which will result in profitable\nmining operations and the achievement of its long term production\ntargets. If these approvals (or other approvals required for the planned\nproduction increases) are not obtained, or if conditional or limited\napprovals are obtained, the economic viability of the relevant projects\nmay be adversely affected, which may in turn result in the value of the\nrelevant assets being impaired.\n\n\nThe Company continues to engage openly and transparently with all\nState and federal Government and approval bodies, while operating\nto the highest safety, environmental and legislative standards to work\ntowards facilitating all approvals in a timely manner.\n\n\n_Estimates of Resources and Reserves and geology_\nThe volume and quality of the coal that the Company recovers may\nbe less than the Resource and Reserve estimates reported to date.\nResource and Reserve estimates are expressions of judgment based\non knowledge, experience and industry practice. There are risks\nassociated with such estimates, including that coal mined may be of\na different quality or grade, tonnage or strip ratio from those in the\nestimates and the ability to economically extract and process the coal\nmay not eventuate. Resource and Reserve estimates are necessarily\nimprecise and depend to some extent on interpretations and\ngeological assumptions, coal prices, cost assumptions, and statistical\ninferences which may ultimately prove to have been unreliable.\n\n\n**76** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\n\n\n**CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (CONTINUED)**\n\n\n\nCoal Resource and Coal Reserve estimates are regularly revised\nbased on actual production experience or new information and could\ntherefore be expected to change. Furthermore, should the Company\nencounter mineralisation or formations different from those predicted\nby past drilling, sampling and similar examinations, Coal Resource\nand Coal Reserve estimates may have to be adjusted and mining\nplans, coal processing and infrastructure may have to be altered in a\nway that might adversely affect their operations. If it is determined that\nmining of certain Coal Reserves are uneconomic, this may lead to a\nreduction in the Company’s aggregate Coal Reserve estimates.\n\n\nMaterial changes in Coal Reserve estimates, grades, strip ratios,\nwashing yields or recovery rates may affect the economic viability\nof projects. Coal Reserve estimates should not be interpreted\nas assurances of mine life or of the profitability of current or\nfuture operations.\n\n\nIf the Company’s actual Coal Resource and Coal Reserve estimates\nare less than current estimates, the Company’s prospects, value,\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition may be\nmaterially adversely affected.\n\n\n_Take or pay liabilities_\nPort and rail (above rail and below rail) capacity is generally contracted\nvia long-term take-or-pay contracts. The Company will generally be\nrequired to pay for its contracted rail or port tonnage irrespective of\nwhether it is utilised. Unused port or rail capacity can arise as a result\nof circumstances including insufficient production from a given mine,\na mismatch between port and rail capacity for a mine, or an inability\nto transfer the used capacity due to contractual limitations such as\nrequired consent of the provider of the port or rail services, or because\nthe coal must emanate from specified source mines or be loaded onto\ntrains at specified load points.\n\n\nThe Company currently has excess port and rail capacity\ncommitments across its NSW operations, which represents a\nsignificant cost to its NSW operations. Delays in the Company’s\nNSW growth projects may exacerbate the Company’s current\nexcess position.\n\n\n_Uncertainty in costs forecast_\nThe business operations and financial condition of the Company\nmay vary with fluctuations in production and capital costs. Changes\nin the costs of mining and processing operations as well as capital\ncosts could occur, including as a result of unforeseen events, such\nas international and local economic and political events (including\nmovement in exchange rates) or unexpected geological or mining\nconditions, and could have material adverse financial consequences\nfor the Company.\n\n\n_NICG and WICET debt_\n\nAs a shipper in NCIG and WICET, the Company’s source mines are\nrequired to maintain a minimum level of Marketable Coal Reserves\n(11 years’ worth of contracted capacity). Non-compliance with\nthis requirement would ultimately result in the termination of the\nindividual contracts and require the Company to pay its share of any\noutstanding senior debt, currently approximately, A$1 billion and\nA$0.3 billion, respectively.\n\n\n\n_Mine closure_\n\nClosure of any of the mines or other operations of the Company\nbefore the end of their mine life (e.g. due to environmental, geological,\ngeotechnical, commercial and/or health and safety issues), could\ntrigger significant employee redundancy costs, closure and\nrehabilitation expense and other costs or loss of revenues. Many\nof these costs will also be incurred where mines are closed at the\nend of their planned mine life or placed on care and maintenance. A\nmove to care and maintenance has the potential to trigger significant\nemployee redundancy costs and a subsequent loss of revenues, as a\nminimal employee presence is required for ongoing management and\nrehabilitation of the mine.\n\n\nIf one or more of the relevant sites are closed earlier than anticipated,\nthe Company will be required to fund the closure costs on an\nexpedited basis and potentially lose revenues, which could have an\nadverse financial effect. In addition, there is a risk that claims may be\nmade arising from environmental remediation upon closure of one or\nmore of their sites.\n\n\n_Coal supply agreements_\nThe Company’s coal supply agreements typically require the delivery\nof a fixed or minimum quantity of coal at a location, at a time and\nover a period stipulated in the agreement. To the extent that any\ncontracted volumes cannot be delivered as agreed, the Company\nmay be liable to pay substantial compensation for the resulting losses,\ncosts and charges (including demurrage) incurred by the buyer.\n\n\nAs customer contracts expire, the Company will be likely to renew\ncontracts with long-term customers, or seek to enter into new\ncontracts with new buyers and markets, depending on the feasibility\nof this. Tonnes that are not contracted are sold onto the spot market\nat either index-linked or fixed price levels. The Company’s strategy\nfor 2018 will be to increase its term contracted position as well as to\ntarget end-user customers as opposed to traders.\n\n\nMost of the Company’s coal supply agreements also require the\ndelivery of coal meeting specified quality thresholds for characteristics\nsuch as moisture content, sulphur content and ash content.\nDepending on these quality thresholds, coal will be sold into markets\nthat are the highest paying for coal with the relevant qualities.\n\n\n_Joint ventures and reliance on third parties_\nThe Company holds a number of joint venture interests, including\ninterests in the Middlemount, Moolarben, HVO, Mount Thorley and\nWarkworth joint ventures, PWCS, NCIG and WICET, with other\nparties. Decision making, management, marketing and other key\naspects of each joint venture are regulated by agreements between\nthe relevant joint venture participants. Under these agreements,\ncertain decisions require the endorsement of third party joint\nventure participants and the Company relies on the co-operation\nof these third parties for the success of its current operations and/\nor the development of its growth projects and the transportation of\nincreased production.\n\n\nThe Company cannot control the actions of third party joint venture\nparticipants, and therefore cannot guarantee that joint ventures will\nbe operated or managed in accordance with the preferred direction\nor strategy of the Company. There is a risk that the veto rights of,\nor consents required from, the joint venture partners will prevent the\nbusiness and assets of a joint venture from being developed, operated\nand managed in accordance with that preferred direction or strategy.\n\n\nThe Company also use contractors and other third parties for\nexploration, mining and other services generally, and is reliant on\na number of third parties for the success of its current operations\nand for the development of its growth projects. While this is normal\nfor the mining and exploration industry, problems caused by third\nparties may arise which may have an impact on the performance and\noperations of the Company. Any failure by counterparties to perform\ntheir obligations may have a material adverse effect on the Company\nand there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in\nattempting to enforce its contractual rights through legal action.\n\n\n_Competition_\nThe coal industry is highly competitive, and an increase in production\nor reduction in prices of competing coal from both Australia and\noverseas may adversely impact the Company’s ability to sell its coal\nproducts and the price to be attained for sales. Increased competition\nin the future, including from new competitors, may emerge. This\ncompetition may relate not only to coal produced and sold, but\nalso to competition for the acquisition of new projects, which may\nadversely affect the ability of the Company to acquire new interests on\nacceptable terms should it wish to make such acquisitions.\n\n\nFurther industry consolidation could result in competitors improving\ntheir scale or productivity or competitors may develop lower-cost\ngeological coal resources or develop resources in lower cost base\ngeographies, increasing pressure on the Company’s ability to maintain\nits margins.\n\n\nThere is significant competition within the resources industry in\nAustralia, the United States and Asia. Furthermore, new entrants\nto the industry may emerge in one or more of those markets,\nincreasing the competitive pressure on the Company. This pressure\ncould adversely affect the Company’s market share and financial\nperformance and position.\n\n\n_Title risks_\n\nExploring or mining for coal is generally illegal without a tenement\ngranted by the State Governments. The grant and renewal of\ntenements is subject to a regulatory regime and each tenement\nis subject to certain conditions. There is no certainty that an\napplication for grant or renewal of a tenement will be granted at all\nor on satisfactory terms or within expected timeframes. Further, the\nconditions attached to tenements may change. The permitting rules\nare complex and may change over time, making the title holder’s\nresponsibility to comply with the applicable requirements more\nonerous, more costly or even impossible, thereby precluding or\nimpairing continuing or future mining operations. There is a risk that\nthe Company may lose title to any of its granted titles if it is unable\nto comply with conditions or if the land subject to the title is required\nfor public purposes. There is also a risk that a tenement may not\nbe granted from any applications for renewals of tenements or for\nnew tenements.\n\n\nObtaining mining tenements often involves first obtaining consents\nfrom landholders and other third parties, some of which may in\ncertain circumstances have a right of veto, as well as approvals\n(such as environmental approvals). There is a risk that the requisite\nconsents and approvals may not be able to be obtained on time\nor on acceptable commercial terms, or may not be able to be\nobtained at all, and consequently have an adverse financial effect on\nthe Company.\n\n\n\n**CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT** ANNUAL REPORT **2017** **77**\n\n\n_Native Title_\n\nWhere the grant or renewal of a tenement is in respect of land in\nrelation to which native title may exist, the Company will need to\ncomply with the NTA in order for the tenement to be validly granted.\n\n\nCompliance with the NTA (and the relevant native title process to\nbe followed for the grant of the tenement e.g. the right to negotiate\nprocess) may be prolonged or delayed, and substantial compensation\nmay be payable as part of any agreement reached, including for\nthe extinguishment or impairment of the relevant native title rights\nand interests.\n\n\nThe existence or determination of native title may, therefore, affect the\nexisting or future activities of the Company and impact on its ability\nto develop projects which may in turn impact its operational and\nfinancial performance.\n\n\n_Overlapping tenement risks_\nSome of the Company’s mines and associated tenements adjoin or\nare overlapped by petroleum tenements and adjoin other exploration\ninterests held by third parties. Overlapping tenements could potentially\nprevent, delay or increase the cost of the future development of\nthe Company’s projects because the Company and the relevant\npetroleum exploration licence or other exploration licence holders\ncould potentially seek to undertake their respective activities on the\noverlapping area or the same resource seams and in some cases the\noverlapping petroleum tenure holder’s consent may be required _._\n\n\nThere is no guarantee that agreement will be reached with the\noverlapping petroleum tenement holder or that agreement will not\nbe delayed or will be reached on terms satisfactory to the Company.\nThere is also a risk that if agreement cannot be reached with\noverlapping tenement holders the matter may be referred to the\nrelevant minister or a court who may make a decision which adversely\nimpacts upon or prevents the project proposed by the Company.\n\n\n_Enforcement and counterparty insolvency risks_\nThe Company has entered into contracts which are important to the\nfuture of its businesses including (but not limited to) for the provision of\ncoal handling services, long term sales contracts, debt facilities, long\nterm leases, contract mining and the provision of certain guarantees,\nindemnities and sureties.\n\n\nAny failure by counterparties to perform those contracts may\nhave a material adverse effect on the Company and there can be\nno assurance that it would be successful in enforcing any of its\ncontractual rights through legal action.\n\n\nIn addition, any insolvency of a counterparty to any of these contracts\nmay have a material adverse effect on the Company and there can\nbe no assurance that it would be successful in enforcing any of its\ncontractual rights through legal action or recovering all monies owned\nby that counterparty (including under any claim for damages).\n\n\n_Coal royalties_\nRoyalties are payable to the NSW and QLD state governments\non coal produced in NSW and QLD. In both states, the royalties\nare payable on an ad valorem basis as they are calculated as a\npercentage of the value for which the coal is sold. The relevant\nState Governments may increase these royalties or their method of\ncalculation. Any impost of new royalty related state tax or increase in\nroyalty rates may have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial\nposition and/or financial performance.\n\n\n**78** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\n\n\n**CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (CONTINUED)**\n\n\n\n_Climate change/carbon regulation risks_\nThe regulatory response to the risk of climate change, including\nunilateral and collective action by Australia and other countries, may\naffect demand for coal, coal prices and the competitiveness of the\nCompany’s products in the world energy market.\n\n\nIn November 2014, an agreement was announced between the\nUnited States and China to cut greenhouse gas emissions by more\nthan 25% below 2005 levels by 2025. This agreement was followed\nby the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, and the\nsigning of the Paris Agreement within the United Nationals Framework\nConvention on Climate Change. The Paris Agreement was signed\nby representatives from 195 countries, and aims to hold back the\nincrease in global temperatures, increase the ability of countries to\nadapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and provide channels\nto finance projects that lead to greenhouse gas reductions.\n\n\nIn recent years, China has also taken steps to address severe air\npollution in many Chinese cities by adopting a range of policies to\nlower carbon emissions and reduce coal usage.\n\n\nExtensive government regulations relating to climate change impose\ncosts on the mining operations of the Company, and future regulations\ncould increase those costs, limit the Company’s ability to produce and\nsell coal, or reduce demand for the Company’s coal products.\n\n\n_Technological change_\nThermal coal as a source of energy competes with other forms of\nelectricity generation (such as hydro, solar and wind). In recent years,\nthe global shift from conventional fuels to renewable sources of energy\nhas created greater competition for thermal coal in the market.\n\n\nAs renewable technologies become more efficient and cost effective,\nthey may gain an economic advantage over coal-fired and other\nfossil fuel based electricity generation. These economic factors,\ncombined with increasing costs to comply with emission limits for\nother air pollutants, may result in the continued retirement of existing\ncoal-powered generation capacity, and the cancellation of planned\nadditional coal-fired power capacity, which may reduce demand for\nthermal coal in the market.\n\n\n_Key personnel_\nA number of key personnel are important to attaining the business\ngoals of the Company. One or more of these key employees could\nleave their employment or cease to actively participate in the\nmanagement of the Company and this may adversely affect the ability\nof the Company to conduct its business and, accordingly, affect its\nfinancial performance and its share price. There may be a limited\nnumber of persons with the requisite experience and skills to serve in\nthe Company’s senior management positions if existing management\nleave the Company. If the Company cannot attract, train and retain\nqualified managers, and other personnel, the Company may be\nunable to successfully manage its growth or otherwise compete\neffectively in the Australian coal industry.\n\n\n\n_Environmental activism_\n\nEnvironmental lobby groups in both QLD and NSW have recently\nmade submissions opposing both operation and expansion of coal\nmines in an attempt to prevent new mine developments or expansion\nof existing mines on the basis of environmental concerns. Increased\ncommunity concern and adverse actions taken by community and\nenvironmental groups may delay or prevent the Company from\nprogressing new mine developments or development or expansion\nof existing mines, or may mean that those mines are subject to\nconditions that adversely affect their profitability and consequently the\nfinancial performance of the Company.\n\n\n_Changes in government policy, regulation or legislation_\nThe resources industry is subject to extensive legislation,\nregulations and supervision by a number of federal and state\nregulatory organisations.\n\n\nAny future legislation and regulatory change may affect the\nresources industry and may adversely affect the Company’s financial\nperformance and position, such as future laws that may limit the\nemission of greenhouse gases or the use of coal in power generation.\n\n\n_Environment and planning_\nIn recent years, state government policies of NSW and QLD have\nbeen introduced in the interests of protecting agricultural and urban\nland from the effects of mining. These include the QLD Government’s\nCentral Queensland Plan and Regional Planning Interests Act and\nthe NSW Government’s Strategic Regional Land Use Policy, Aquifer\nInterference Policy, and 2013 amendments to the State Environmental\nPlanning Policy (Mining, Petroleum Production and Extractive\nIndustries) 2007. Each of these policies is relevant to the areas in\nwhich the Company has mining operations. Accordingly, there is no\nassurance that the future development and exploration activities of\nthe Company will result in profitable or commercially viable mining\noperations in these areas.\n\n\nIn 2013, the NSW State Government introduced the fit and proper\nperson consideration in making decisions about mining rights\nincluding the grant, transfer, renewal, cancellation and suspension\nof such rights. This allows the Government to consider a miner’s\nconduct (in particular its compliance with environmental and mining\nlegislation), as well as a miner’s financial capabilities and technical\nexpertise. In recent years, the NSW State Government has also\nsignificantly increased the maximum penalties for breaches of mining\nand environmental legislation, and the resources of regulators to\ninvestigate possible breaches and prosecute mining companies.\nThese changes have resulted in the updating of compliance\nprograms, and increased the risk of prosecution for breaches of\nrelevant legislation.\n\n\nIn 2013, the QLD State Government reviewed the method of\ncalculating the financial assurance required to be provided by mining\ncompanies in respect of their rehabilitation liability and this review\nled to a significant increase in financial assurance amounts that are\nrequired to be covered by bank guarantees. The Audit Office of\nNSW has carried out a review of rehabilitation liabilities in respect of\nmines and the review has led to an increase in the amount of security\nrequired in respect of rehabilitation liabilities.\n\n\n_Litigation_\nLike all companies in the resources sector, the Company is exposed\nto the risks of litigation (either as the complainant or as the defendant),\nwhich may have a material adverse effect on the financial position of\nthe relevant entity. The Company could become exposed to claims or\nlitigation by persons alleging they are owed fees or other contractual\nentitlements, employees, regulators, competitors or other third parties.\n\n\n_Insurance_\n\nThe Company has insurance coverage for certain operating risks.\nHowever, it may become subject to liability (including in relation to\npollution, occupational illnesses or other hazards), or suffer loss\nresulting from business interruption, for which it is not insured (or has\nnot sufficiently insured) or cannot insure, including liabilities in respect\nof past activities.\n\n\nShould a major uninsured loss be suffered, future financial\nperformance could be materially adversely affected. In addition,\ninsurance may not continue to be available at economically\nacceptable premiums. As a result, the insurance coverage may\nnot cover the full scope and extent of claims against the Company\nor losses it may incur, including, but not limited to, claims for\nenvironmental or industrial accidents, occupational illnesses, pollution\nand product liability, war, terrorism and business interruption.\n\n\nTo the extent a successful claim against the Company proceeds, it\nmay have a material adverse effect on its financial position.\n\n\n_Exploration and development risks_\nThere are several risks relating to coal mining exploration and\ndevelopment which are common to the industry and which, if realised,\nhave the capacity to affect operations, production, cash flow and\nfinancial performance of the Company.\n\n\nDevelopment and exploration activities may be affected by factors\nbeyond the control of the Company, including geological conditions,\nseismic activity, mineralisation, consistency and predictability of coal\ngrades, changes to law, changes to the regulatory framework applying\nto mining, overlapping resources tenure, and the rights of indigenous\npeople on whose land exploration activities are undertaken.\n\n\nAny discovery of a coal deposit does not guarantee that the mining\nof that deposit would be commercially viable, with the size of the\ndeposit, development and operating costs, land ownership, coal\nprices and recovery rates all being key factors in determining\ncommercial viability.\n\n\nIssues that arise during development, construction and mine startup may result in increased costs, delayed commencement of coal\nproduction, delayed receipt of coal revenue or coal production not\ncommencing at all. These problems may include delays in obtaining\napprovals (including land use approvals) or in the construction of mine\ninfrastructure. There are many milestones which need to be met in a\ntimely fashion for production to commence on any projects currently\nin the pre-development or development stages.\n\n\nThe Company may also be exposed to risks including risks of default\nassociated with managing contractual relationships with participants\nin any of the development or exploration joint ventures or other\ncontractual relationships to which it is, or may become, a party.\n\n\n\n**CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT** ANNUAL REPORT **2017** **79**\n\n\n_Transport and infrastructure_\nCoal produced from the Company’s mining operations is transported\nto customers by a combination of road, rail and sea.\n\n\nA number of factors could disrupt or restrict access to essential coal\ntransportation and handling services, including (but not limited to):\n\n\n–– weather related problems;\n\n\n–– key equipment and infrastructure failures;\n\n\n–– rail or port capacity constraints;\n\n\n–– congestions and inter-system losses;\n\n\n–– industrial action;\n\n\n–– failure to obtain consents from third parties for access to rail\nor land;\n\n\n–– failure or delay in the construction of new rail or port capacity;\n\n\n–– failure to meet contractual requirements;\n\n\n–– access is removed or not granted by regulatory authority;\n\n\n–– breach of regulatory framework;\n\n\n–– mismatch of below rail capacity, above rail capacity and port\ncapacity; and\n\n\n–– possible sale of infrastructure,\n\n\nall or any of which could impair the Company’s ability to supply coal\nto customers and/or increase costs, and consequently may have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company’s financial position.\n\n\nSignificant increases in transport costs (such as emissions control\nrequirements and fluctuations in the price of diesel fuel and\ndemurrage) could make the Company’s coal less competitive when\ncompared to other fuels or coal produced from other regions.\n\n\n_Environmental risks_\n\nDue to the nature of coal mining processes, and the associated\nby-products, residues and tailings generated from these processes,\nall operations of the Company are subject to stringent environmental\nlaws and regulations.\n\n\nThere is a risk that past, present or future operations have not met\nor will not meet environmental or related regulatory requirements\nand/or that the approvals or modifications the Company is currently\nseeking, or may need to seek in the future, will not be granted. If\nthe Company is unsuccessful in these efforts or otherwise breaches\nthese environmental requirements, it may incur fines or penalties, be\nrequired to curtail or cease operations and/or be subject to increased\ncompliance costs or costs for rehabilitation or rectification works,\nwhich have not been previously planned at one or more of its sites.\n\n\nEnvironmental legislation may change in a manner that may require\ncompliance with additional standards, and a heightened degree of\nresponsibility for companies and their directors and employees. There\nmay also be unforeseen environmental liabilities resulting from coal\nrelated activities, which may be costly to remedy. In particular, the\nacceptable level of pollution and the potential abandonment costs\nand obligations for which the Company may become liable as a\nresult of its activities may be impossible to assess under the current\nlegal framework.\n\n\n**80** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\n\n\n**CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (CONTINUED)**\n\n\n\n_Health, safety and hazardous materials risks_\nThe Company’s operations may substantially impact the environment\nor cause exposure to hazardous materials. It will use hazardous\nmaterials and will generate hazardous waste, and may be subject to\ncommon law claims, damages due to natural disasters, and other\ndamages, as well as the investigation and clean-up of soil, surface\nwater, groundwater, and other media. Such claims may arise, for\nexample, out of current or former activities at sites that it owns\nor operates.\n\n\nThere is also a risk that actions could be brought against the\nCompany, alleging adverse effects of such substances on personal\nhealth. If any injuries or accidents occur in a mine, this could have\nadverse financial implications including legal claims for personal injury,\nwrongful death, amendments to approvals, potential production\ndelays or stoppages, any of which may have a material adverse effect\non the financial performance and/or financial position of the Company.\n\n\nThere is a risk that past, present or future operations have not met,\nor will not meet, health and safety requirements and/or that the\napprovals or modifications the Company is currently seeking, or may\nneed to seek in the future, will not be granted at all or on terms that\nare unduly onerous. If the Company is unsuccessful in these efforts or\notherwise breaches these health and safety requirements, it may incur\nfines or penalties, be required to curtail or cease operations and/or\nbe subject to increased compliance costs or costs for rehabilitation or\nrectification works, which have not been previously planned at one or\nmore of its sites.\n\n\n_Impairment risks_\nThe Company’s balance sheet includes a number of assets that are\nsubject to impairment risk, including mining tenements, exploration\nand evaluation assets, goodwill, the Middlemount loan and royalty\nreceivable, the Watagan loan receivable and investments accounted\nfor using the equity method.\n\n\nThe value of these assets is derived from the fundamental valuation\nof the underlying mining operations and as such is subject to many of\nthe risks including, but not limited to, coal price and demand, foreign\nexchange, coal production, estimates of reserves and resources,\nuncertainty in costs forecasts, operating risks, injury and mine closure.\n\n\nAdverse changes in these risk factors could lead to a reduction in the\nvaluation of the Company’s assets and result in an impairment charge\nbeing recognised.\n\n\nInternal audit function\n\nThe internal audit function is managed by the Executive General\nManager ( **EGM** ) of Risk Management and Auditing. That person\nhas direct access to the chair of the Audit and Risk Management\nCommittee, as well as to the CEC, to whom he directly reports. The\nAudit and Risk Management Committee recommends to the Board\nthe appointment of the EGM Risk Management and Auditing.\n\n\nWhere appropriate the internal audit function is supported primarily by\nexternal consultants.\n\n\nThe EGM of Risk Management and Auditing has unfettered access\nto the Audit and Risk Management Committee and its chair to\nseek information and explanations. The chair of the Audit and Risk\nManagement Committee meets independently with the EGM Risk\nManagement and Auditing.\n\n\nThe role of the EGM Risk Management and Auditing includes\nachievement of the internal audit objectives, risk management policies\nand insurance strategy.\n\n\n\nAn annual program for internal audit and risk assurance is provided\nto the Audit and Risk Management Committee for approval. The\nannual Internal Audit program is focused on key operating risks and\nprocesses design and effectiveness.\n\n\nThe program includes a review of compliance with the obligations\nimposed by the US Sarbanes Oxley Act ( **SOX** ), including evaluating\nand documenting internal controls as required by section 404 of SOX.\n\n\nA status report on the execution of the plan, including current findings\nand actions is provided to the Audit and Risk Management Committee\nat each quarterly meeting. Any material findings are reported to\nthe Board.\n\n\nThe Audit and Risk Management Committee receives a report on key\nissues and subsequently corrective actions are monitored, reviewed\nand reported.\n\n\nHealth, Safety and Environment Compliance\nThe Company has adopted policies to comply with occupational\nhealth, safety, environment and other laws. The Board has approved\na Health, Safety and Environment Policy which applies across the\nCompany. In addition, each mine site has its own health, safety and\nenvironmental policies and procedures to deal with their particular\nhealth, safety and environmental issues. The Board has established a\nHealth, Safety and Environment Committee to assist it in overseeing\nthe Company’s health, safety and environmental responsibilities.\nIn accordance with its charter, this committee has at least three\nmembers. The current members of this committee are David Moult\n(appointed 6 February 2018) (Chair of the committee), Geoffrey Raby\nand Fuqi Wang. Vincent O’Rourke resigned as chair of the Committee\non 30 January 2018. It is intended the committee meets at least four\ntimes per year, or as frequently as required. The committee meetings\nare held at one of the Company’s mine sites, whenever possible, to\nreceive feedback from the health, safety and environment forum held\nat the mine site and to address any mine specific health, safety and\nenvironment issues.\n\n\n**Principle 8: Remunerate fairly and responsibly**\n\nNomination and Remuneration Committee\n\nThe Board has established a Nomination and Remuneration\nCommittee. In accordance with its Charter, this committee currently\nhas 4 members, Xiyong Li (Chair of the committee), Cunliang Lai,\nXiangqian Wu (appointed 15 May 2017) and Helen Gillies (appointed\n6 February 2018). William Randall resigned as a member of the\nCommittee on 9 November 2017. Three of the members of the\ncommittee, including the chair of the committee are not independent\ndirectors of the Company. However, the Board considers them\nappropriate members, and in the case of Xiyong Li, an appropriate\nchair of this committee, due to their skill set, experience and seniority,\nand that the overall composition of the Nomination and Remuneration\nCommittee is appropriate.\n\n\nThree of the committee members are non-independent Non-Executive\nDirectors who are not remunerated by the Company for their roles as\ndirectors or committee members. The purpose of the committee is\noutlined in the Board Committees section above.\n\n\nThe committee makes recommendations to the Board to achieve\nCompany remuneration structures that are equitable and aligned\nwith the long-term interests of the Company and its shareholders, to\nattract and retain skilled employees, to structure short and long term\nincentives that are challenging and linked to creation of sustainable\nreturns and to ensure any termination benefits are justifiable and\nappropriate. The committee has recently engaged an external advisor\n\n\n**CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT** ANNUAL REPORT **2017** **81**\n\n\n\nto assist with the evaluation of remuneration structures for NonExecutive Directors, Executive Directors and senior management.\n\n\nThe committee has the necessary power and resources to meet\nits responsibilities under its charter, including rights of access to\nmanagement, auditors and external advisers. It is intended that\nthe committee will meet at least once per year, or as frequently\nas required.\n\n\n_Remuneration of Non-Executive Directors_\n\nThe Constitution provides that the Non-Executive Directors are\nentitled to such remuneration as approved by the Company’s\nshareholders in accordance with the Constitution, which must not\nexceed the aggregate annual amount as determined by the Company\nin general meeting or by its major shareholder, Yanzhou.\n\n\nRemuneration for Non-Executive Directors is capped at an aggregate\namount for each financial year of $3.5 million. Non-Executive\nDirectors may also be paid such additional or special remuneration\nas the directors decide is appropriate where a Non-Executive\nDirector performs extra services or makes special exertions for\nthe benefit of the Company. Such additional remuneration will not\nform part of the calculation of the aggregate cap on Non-Executive\nDirectors’ remuneration for a financial year and do not require\nshareholder approval.\n\n\nFurther details of the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors,\nexecutive directors and senior executives can be found in the\nRemuneration Report on pages 52 to 63.\n\n\nThe Nomination and Remuneration Committee Charter can be found\nwithin the Corporate Governance section of the Company’s website.\n\n\n_Dealings in Company securities_\nBy law, and under the Company’s Insider Trading Policy, dealing in\nCompany securities is subject to the overriding prohibition on trading\nwhile in possession of inside information.\n\n\nIn addition, the Company’s Share Trading Policy prohibits dealing\nin Company securities or Yanzhou securities by directors, senior\nexecutives and other relevant employees, as well as their closely\nrelated parties, during specified blackout periods each year. General\nemployees are permitted to deal in Company securities outside these\nblackout periods, however additional approval requirements apply\nto directors, the CEO and CFO. The Share Trading Policy precludes\nrelevant employees from entering into any hedge or derivative\ntransactions relating to unvested options or share rights granted to\nthem under incentive plans and securities that are subject to holding\nlocks or restrictions on dealing under such plans. There are also\nrestrictions that apply to relevant employees from entering into margin\nlending arrangements and short-term trading of the Company’s\nsecurities. Breaches of the policy are treated seriously and may lead\nto disciplinary action, including dismissal.\n\n\nCopies of the Company’s Share Trading Policy and Insider Trading\nPolicy are available on the Corporate Governance section of the\nCompany’s website.\n\n\n_This Director independence_\nThis has been approved by the Board and is current as at\n28 February 2018.\n\n\n**82** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA

PREPARATION**\n\n\n\nThe consolidated financial statements and notes are for the\nconsolidated entity consisting of Yancoal Australia Ltd (“Company”\nor “parent entity”) and its subsidiaries (“the Group”).\n\n\nThese general purpose financial statements have been prepared\nin accordance with the Australian Accounting Standards and\ninterpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board\nand the _Corporations Act 2001_ . Yancoal Australia Ltd is a for-profit\nentity for the purpose of preparing the financial statements.\n\n\nThe financial statements were authorised for issue in accordance with\na resolution of the Directors on 28 February 2018.\n\n\n_(i) Compliance with IFRS_\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group also comply with\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the\nInternational Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”).\n\n\n_(ii) Subsidiaries_\nThe Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has\nrights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has\nthe ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.\n\n\nSubsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is\ntransferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date that\ncontrol ceases.\n\n\nThe acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business\ncombinations by the Group. Intercompany transactions, balances\nand unrealised gains on transactions between the Group companies\nare eliminated.\n\n\nUnrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides\nevidence of the impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting\npolicies of subsidiaries are aligned to ensure consistency with the\npolicies adopted by the Group.\n\n\n_(iii) Significant accounting policies_\nSignificant accounting policies have been included in the\nrelevant notes to which the policies relate, and other significant\naccounting policies are discussed in Note F5. These policies\nhave been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless\notherwise stated.\n\n\n_(iv) Historical cost convention_\nThese financial statements have been prepared on an accrual\nbasis and under the historical cost convention, as modified by the\nrevaluation of available for sale financial assets and financial assets\nand liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through\nprofit or loss.\n\n\n_(v) Rounding of amounts_\nThe Company is of a kind referred to in ASIC Legislative Instrument\n2016/191, issued by the Australian Securities and Investments\nCommission, relating to the ‘rounding off’ of amounts in the financial\nstatements. Amounts in the financial statements have been rounded\noff in accordance with that legislative instrument to the nearest million\ndollars, or in certain cases, the nearest dollar.\n\n\n\n_(vi) New and amended standards adopted by the Group_\nThe Group has not elected to apply any other pronouncements\nbefore their operative date in the annual reporting period beginning\n1 January 2017.\n\n\nThe new standards that are applicable to for the first time for the year\nended 31 December 2017 are:\n\n\n–– AASB 2016-1 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards –\nRecognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses\n\n\n–– AASB 2016-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards –\nDisclosure Initiative: Amendments to AASB 107\n\n\nThese standards have introduced new disclosures for the Annual\nFinancial Report but did not affect the Group’s accounting policies or\nany of the amounts recognised in the financial statements.\n\n\n_(vii) Impact of standards issued but not yet applied by the Group_\nAustralian Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued but not\nyet applicable for the year ended 31 December 2017 that not been\napplied by the Group are disclosed in Note F7.\n\n\n_(viii) Early adoption of standards_\nCertain new accounting standards and interpretations have been\npublished that are not mandatory for 31 December 2017 reporting\nperiods and have not been early adopted by the Group. The Group’s\nassessment of the impact of these new standards and interpretations\nis set out below.\n\n\n_(ix) Critical accounting estimates_\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the use of certain\ncritical accounting estimates that involve a higher degree of judgement\nor complexity. It also requires management to exercise its judgement\nin the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies.\n\n\nThe Directors evaluate estimates and judgements incorporated\ninto these financial statements based on historical knowledge and\nbest available current information. Estimates assume a reasonable\nexpectation of future events and are based on current trends and\neconomic data, obtained both externally and within the Company.\nThe resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the\nrelated actual results.\n\n\nDetails of critical accounting estimates and judgements can be found\nin the notes to which they relate and include income taxes B6, mining\ntenements C2, impairment of assets C3, exploration and evaluation\nassets C4, trade and other receivables C7, royalty receivable C9,\nprovisions C10, acquisition of Coal & Allied E1, and control of\nWatagan E2.\n\n\n**FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** ANNUAL REPORT **2017** **87**\n\n\n\n_(x) Going concern_\nFor the year ended 31 December 2017, the Group had a profit after\nincome tax of $229 million (31 December 2016: loss after income tax\nof $227 million) from continuing operations and a net cash flow from\noperating activities of $408 million (31 December 16: cash outflow of\n$24 million).

This measure excludes\nthe effects of non-recurring expenditure from the operating segments such as restructuring costs, business combination related expenses and\nsignificant impairments of cash-generating units. Furthermore, the measure excludes the effects of fair value re-measurements and foreign\nexchange gains/(losses) on interest-bearing liabilities.

Reportable segment’s\ncapital expenditure is set out in Note B1(a).\n\n\nAll segment assets are located in Australia.\n\n\n(iv) Segment liabilities\nA measure of total liabilities for reportable segments are not provided to the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee reviews the\nliabilities of the Group at a consolidated level.\n\n\n**FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** ANNUAL REPORT **2017** **91**\n\n\n**B2 REVENUE**\n\n\n**Accounting Policies**\n\nRevenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Amounts disclosed as revenue are net of returns, trade\nallowances, rebates and amounts collected on behalf of third parties.\n\n\nThe Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured and it is probable that future economic benefits will\nflow to the entity. Revenue is recognised in the profit or loss as follows:\n\n\n(i) Sale of coal\nRevenue from the sale of coal is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and\ncan be measured reliably. Risks and rewards are considered passed to the buyer at the time of delivery, usually on a Free On Board (“FOB”)\nbasis. On occasion the sale of coal is recognised as the ship pulls into harbour on a Free Alongside Ship (“FAS”) basis or from the stockpile\non an ex-works basis.\n\n\n(ii) Interest\nInterest income from a financial asset is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate\napplicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that\nasset’s net carrying amount. Interest income from a finance lease is recognised over the term of the lease based on a pattern reflecting a\nconstant periodic rate of return on the net investment in the lease.\n\n\n(iii) Services\nRevenue from the rendering of a service is recognised upon the delivery of the service to the customer.\n\n\n(iv) Other\nOther primarily consists of dividends, rents, sub-lease rental and management fees. Dividends are recognised as revenue when the right\nto receive payment is established.

In determining the liability, consideration is given to employee salary and wage increases and the probability that\nthe employee may satisfy any vesting requirements. Those cash flows are discounted using corporate bonds with terms to maturity that\nmatch the expected timing of cash flows attributable to employee benefits.\n\n\nAdditional Long Service Leave payments are made monthly to the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Corporation based\non the eligible monthly payroll of employees involved in the mining of black coal.

An asset for the amount recoverable from the Coal Mining Industry (Long\nService Leave Funding) Corporation is recognised in trade and other receivables.\n\n\nThese employee benefits are presented as current provisions as the Group has no unconditional right to deferred settlement for at least\n12 months after the end of the reporting period.\n\n\n**FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** ANNUAL REPORT **2017** **93**\n\n\n\n**(a) Employee benefits expense**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n**2017**\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n**2016**\n**$M**\n\n\n\nOther employee benefits expenses **281** 174\nDefined contribution superannuation expense **21** 14\nTotal employee benefits expenses from continuing operations **302** 188\n\n\nDuring 2017 $17 million of employee benefits were capitalised (2016: $26 million)\n\n\n**(b) Key management personnel compensation**\nRefer to the remuneration report contained in the directors’ report for details of the remuneration paid or payable to each member of the Group’s\nkey management personnel (KMP) for the year ended 31 December 2017.\n\n\nThe totals of remuneration paid to KMP of the Company and the Group during the year are as follows:\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n**2017**\n**$**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n**2016**\n**$**\n\n\n\nShort-term employee benefits **9,265,818** 4,805,919\nPost-employment benefits **149,362** 142,474\nOther long-term benefits **1,950,142** 1,865,017\n\n**11,365,322** 6,813,410\n\n\n**B5 EXPENSES**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n**2017**\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n**2016**\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**(a) Finance costs**\n\nFinance lease charges **4** 4\n\nUnwinding of discount on provisions and deferred payables **63** 5\nOther interest expenses **229** 215\nInterest expenses capitalised **(9)** (15)\nTotal finance costs from continuing operations **287** 209\n\n\n**(b) Other operating expenses**\n\nNet loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment **4** 7\n\nRental expense relating to operating leases **3** 2\n\nRe-measurement of royalty receivable **–** 6\n\nInsurance **6** 3\n\nBank fees and other charges **109** 114\nStamp duty **167** 12\n\nDuties and other levies **12** 6\n\nTravel and accommodation **8** 8\n\nNet loss on foreign exchange **8** –\n\nInformation & technology expenses **9** 2\nOther operating expenses **4** 3\n\nTotal other operating expenses from continuing operations **330** 163\n\n\n**94** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD **FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\n\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017\n\n\n**B – PERFORMANCE**\n\n\n**B6 TAXATION**\n\n\n**Accounting Policy**\nThe income tax expense or benefit for the period is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable income based on the applicable income\ntax rate enacted or substantially enacted at the end of the reporting period for each jurisdiction, adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets\nand liabilities attributable to temporary differences and to unused tax losses.\n\n\nDeferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and\nliabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for if it\narises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction\naffects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or\nsubstantially enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or\nthe deferred income tax liability is settled.\n\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable\namounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses. The carrying value of the deferred tax asset is reviewed at each\nreporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that future taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the\nasset to be recovered.\n\n\nDeferred tax liabilities and assets are recognised for taxable temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax bases of\ninvestments in controlled entities, except where the parent entity is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and\nit is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when the\ndeferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally\nenforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n\nCurrent and deferred tax is recognised in the profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive\nincome or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.\n\n\n**Tax consolidation legislation**\nYancoal Australia Ltd and its wholly owned Australian controlled entities have implemented the tax consolidation legislation for income tax\npurposes. The accounting policy in relation to this legislation is set out in Note E4.\n\n\n**Critical accounting estimates and judgements**\nThe Group is subject to income taxes in Australia. Significant judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes.\nDeferred tax assets, including those arising from unutilised tax losses, require the Group to assess the likelihood that the Group will generate\nsufficient taxable earnings in future periods, in order to utilise recognised deferred tax assets. Judgement is also required in respect of\nthe application of existing tax laws. Assumptions about the generation of future taxable profits depend on management’s estimates of\nfuture cash flows. These estimates of future taxable income are based on forecast cash flows from operations (which are impacted by\nproduction and sales volumes, coal prices, reserves, operating costs, closure and rehabilitation costs, capital expenditure, and other capital\nmanagement transactions). To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the\nGroup to realise the net deferred tax assets recorded at the reporting date could be impacted. In addition, future changes in tax laws could\nlimit the ability of the Group to obtain tax deductions in future periods.\n\n\n**FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** ANNUAL REPORT **2017** **95**\n\n\n\n**(a) Income tax (expense)/benefit**\n(i) Net tax (expense)/benefit\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n**2017**\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n**2016**\n**$M**\n\n\n\nIncome tax (expense)/benefit **(84)** 73\n\nIncome tax over provision in respect of prior years **2** 12\n\n**(82)** 85\nNet tax (expense)/benefit is attributable to:\nContinuing operations **(82)** 85\n\n(ii) Income tax benefit\nDeferred tax (expense)/benefit **(87)** 85\nDeferred tax (expense)/benefit included in income tax benefit comprises:\n(Decrease)/increase in deferred tax assets (refer to Note B6(b)(i)) **(73)** 157\nIncrease/(decrease) in deferred tax liabilities (refer to Note B6(c)(i)) **(9)** (70)\nMovements in other including assets classified as held for sale **–** (2)\n**(82)** 85\n\n\n(iii) Reconciliation of income tax (expense)/benefit to prima facie tax payable\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n**2017**\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n**2016**\n**$M**\n\n\n\nProfit/(loss) from continuing operations before tax **311** (312)\nTax at the Australian tax rate of 30% (2016 – 30%) **(95)** 94\nTax effect of amounts which are not deductible/taxable in calculating taxable income:\nStamp duty provision expensed **(1)** (4)\nShare of profit/(loss) of equity-accounted investees not deductible **10** (2)\nGain on acquisition of subsidiaries **2** –\n\nPlant and equipment **–** 8\n\nUnder/over provision in prior years **1** 12\nDenial of debt deductions **(1)** (19)\n\nOther **2** (4)\nIncome tax (expense)/benefit **(82)** 85\n\n\n(iv) Amounts recognised directly in equity\n\nAggregate current and deferred tax arising in the reporting period and not recognised in net\nprofit or loss or other comprehensive income but directly debited or credited to equity:\n\nCash flow hedges **173** 27\n\n**–**\nSubordinated Capital Note transaction costs (1)\n\nEntitlement offer issue costs **(20)** –\n\n**153** 26\n\n\n**96** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD **FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\n\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017\n\n\n**B – PERFORMANCE**\n\n\n**B6 TAXATION (CONTINUED)**\n\n\n**(b) Deferred tax assets**\n(i) Deferred tax assets\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n**2017**\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n**2016**\n**$M**\n\n\n\nDeferred tax assets from income tax **1,219** 1,339\n\n\n(ii) Income tax\n\n\n\n**Cash flow**\n**hedges** **Other** **Total**\n**$M** **$M** **$M**\n\n\n\n**Trade and**\n\n**other payables**\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Finance lease**\n\n**liabilities**\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Movements**\n\n\n\n**Tax losses**\n\n**and offsets** **Provisions**\n**$M** **$M**\n\n\n\n**At 1 January 2016** 834 43 10 9 251 18 1,165\n\nUnder/over provision in prior year\n\n–– to profit or loss (14) – – – 24 – 10\n(Charged)/credited\n\n–– to Watagan Group (12) – – – – – (12)\n–– to profit or loss 150 (5) 5 11 – (14) 147\n–– directly to equity (40) – – – 13 – (27)\n\n–– tax loss recorded on behalf of 55 – – – – – 55\nWatagan Group\n\n\n–– directly to other – – – – – 1 1\n\n**At 31 December 2016** 973 38 15 20 288 5 1,339\n\n\n**At beginning of year** 973 38 15 20 288 5 1,339\nUnder/over provision in prior year (44) 1 – – – – (43)\n(Charged)/credited\n\n–– to profit or loss (73) 49 (1) (4) – (1) (30)\n–– directly to equity (20) – – – (153) 20 (153)\n\n–– tax loss recorded on behalf of 1 – – – – – 1\nWatagan Group\n\n\nAcquisition of subsidiaries 2 89 14 – – – 105\n\n**At 31 December 2017** 839 177 28 16 135 24 1,219\n\n\nThe Group’s tax consolidated group includes Watagan Mining Company Pty Ltd and its controlled subsidiaries, refer to E1b(i) for further details.\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for the carry forward of unused tax losses and unused tax credits to the extent that it is probable that taxable\nprofits will be available against which the unused tax losses/credits can be utilised.

Alternatively, the straight-line method\nmay be used where this provides a suitable alternative because\nproduction is not expected to fluctuate significantly from one year\nto another.\n\n\nThe estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation\nmethod are reviewed at the end of each annual reporting\nperiod and any change in estimate is taken into account in the\ndetermination of remaining depreciation charges.\n\n\nThe estimated useful lives are as follows:\n\n\n–– Buildings 10 – 25 years\n\n\n–– Mine development 10 – 40 years\n\n\n–– Plant and equipment 2.5 – 40 years\n\n\n–– Leased plant and equipment 2 – 20 years\n\n\nAn asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its\nrecoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than\nits estimated recoverable amount.\n\n\nAny gain or loss arising on the disposal of an item of property,\nplant and equipment is determined as the difference between\nthe sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is\nrecognised in profit or loss.\n\n\nSee Note C3 for further details on impairment of assets.\n\n\n**100** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD **FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\n\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017\n\n\n**C – OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES**\n\n\n**C1 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (CONTINUED)**\n\n\n\n**Plant and**\n\n**equipment**\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Assets under**\n\n**construction**\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Freehold land**\n\n**& buildings**\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Mine**\n\n**development**\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Leased plant**\n**and equipment**\n**$M** **Total**\n\n\n\n**Year ended 31 December 2016**\n\nOpening net book amount 235 172 303 502 38 1,250\nTransfers – asset under construction (227) 1 92 126 – (8)\n\nAdditions 316 – 14 3 50 383\n\n– – – –\nOther disposals (15) (15)\n\nDepreciation – (3) (28) (47) (6) (84)\nClosing net book amount 324 170 381 569 82 1,526\n\n\n**At 31 December 2016**\n\nCost or fair value 324 182 480 869 103 1,958\n\nAccumulated depreciation – (12) (99) (300) (21) (432)\n\nNet book amount 324 170 381 569 82 1,526\n\n\n**Year ended 31 December 2017**\n\nOpening net book amount 324 170 381 569 82 1,526\nTransfers – asset under construction (576) 27 308 240 – (1)\n\nAdditions 303 – 21 12 9 345\n\nAcquisition through business combination 33 96 353 844 – 1,326\n\n– – –\nOther disposals (17) (7) (24)\n\n–\nDepreciation (4) (45) (98) (8) (155)\nTransfer to assets classified as held for sale (3) (15) (51) (116) – (185)\nClosing net book amount 81 274 967 1,434 76 2,832\n\n\n**At 31 December 2017**\n\nCost 81 330 1,310 2,910 105 4,736\n\nAccumulated depreciation – (56) (343) (1,476) (29) (1,904)\n\nNet book amount 81 274 967 1,434 76 2,832\n\n\nDuring the year ended 31 December 2017 $8 million of depreciation and amortisation was capitalised (2016 $11 million) and $9 million of\ninterest was capitalised (2016 $15 million).\n\n\n**(a) Non-current assets pledged as security**\nRefer to Note D2(b) for information on non-current assets pledged as security by the Group.\n\n\n**FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** ANNUAL REPORT **2017** **101**\n\n\n**C2 MINING TENEMENTS**\n\n\n**Accounting Policy**\nMining tenements have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Mining\ntenements are amortised from the date when commercial production commences, or the date of acquisition. Amortisation is calculated over\nthe life of the mine on a ‘units of production’ method based on the Joint Ore Reserves Committee (“JORC”) estimated reserves.\n\n\nChanges in the annual amortisation rate resulting from changes in the remaining estimated reserves, are applied on a prospective basis from\nthe commencement of the next financial year. Every year the mining tenement’s carrying amount is compared to its recoverable amount and\nassessed for impairment, or for possible reversals of prior year impairment.\n\n\nSee Note C3 for further details on the impairment of assets.\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n**2017**\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n**2016**\n**$M**\n\n\n\nOpening net book amount **2,128** 2,085\n\n–\nAcquisition through business combination **2,456**\n\nTransfers from exploration and evaluation assets **26** 101\n\nImpairment reversal (refer Note C3(b)) **100** –\nAmortisation **(103)** (58)\nTransfer to assets classified as held for sale **(311)** –\nClosing net book amount **4,296** 2,128\n\n\n**Critical accounting estimates and judgements**\n\nCoal reserves and resources\nThe Group estimates its coal resources and reserves based on information compiled by Competent Persons as defined by the Australasian\nCode for Reporting Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (December 2012), which is prepared by the Joint Ore\nReserves Committee (“JORC”) of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Australian Institute of Geoscientists and Minerals\nCouncil of Australia, known as the JORC 2012 Code, and Australian Security Exchange (“ASX”) Listing Rules 2012.\n\n\nMineral Resources and Ore Reserves are based on geological information and technical data relating to the size, depth, quality of coal,\nsuitable production techniques and recovery rates. Such an analysis requires complex geological judgements to interpret the data. The\nestimation of Recoverable Reserves is based on factors such as estimates of foreign exchange rates, coal price, future capital requirements,\nrehabilitation obligations and production costs, along with geological assumptions and judgements made in estimating the size and quality\nof the reserves. Management forms a view of forecast sales prices based on current and long-term historical average price trend.\n\n\nAs the economic assumptions used may change and as additional geological information is produced during the operations of a mine,\nestimates of reserves may change. Additionally the amount of reserves that may actually be mined in the future and the Group’s current\nreserve estimate may vary. Such changes may impact the Group’s reported financial position and results including:\n\n\n–– the carrying value of the exploration and evaluation assets, mine properties, property, plant and equipment and goodwill may be affected\ndue to changes in estimated future cash flows;\n\n–– depreciation and amortisation charges in the statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income may change where such\ncharges are determined using the units of production method, or where the useful life of the related assets change; and\n\n\n–– the carrying value of deferred income tax assets may change due to changes in the judgements regarding the existence of such assets\nand in estimates of the likely recovery of such assets.\n\n\n**102** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD **FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\n\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017\n\n\n**C – OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES**\n\n\n**C3 IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS**\n\n\n**Accounting policies**\n(i) Long term assets\nMining tenements and goodwill are tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that\nthey might be impaired.\n\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable\namount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. Mining tenements and other\nnon-financial assets (excluding goodwill) that have previously suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at\nthe end of each reporting period.\n\n\nFor the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped into Cash-Generating Units (“CGU”), being the lowest levels for which there\nare separately identifiable cash inflows which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. For the\npurposes of goodwill impairment testing, CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment\nis tested reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. The goodwill acquired in a business\ncombination, for the purpose of impairment testing, is allocated to CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.\n\n\nThe Group assesses impairment by evaluation of conditions and events specific to the Company that may be indicative of\nimpairment triggers.\n\n\n(ii) Other financial assets\nThe Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial\nassets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective\nevidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that\nloss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be\nreliably estimated.\n\n\nIf there is evidence of impairment for any of the Group’s financial assets carried at amortised cost, the loss is measured as the difference\nbetween the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, excluding future credit losses that have not been\nincurred. The cash flows are discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The loss is recognised in profit or loss.\n\n\n**Critical accounting estimates and judgements**\nThe determination of fair value and value in use requires management to make estimates and assumptions about expected production\nand sales volumes, coal prices (considering current and historical prices, price trends and related factors), foreign exchange rates, coal\nresources and reserves (refer to C2), operating costs, closure and rehabilitation costs and future capital expenditure. These estimates and\nassumptions are subject to risk and uncertainty; hence there is a possibility that changes in circumstances will alter these projections, which\nmay impact the recoverable amount of the assets. In such circumstances, some or all of the carrying amount of the assets may be further\nimpaired or the impairment charge reduced with the impact recorded in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n\n**(a) CGU assessment**\nThe Group operates on a regional basis within NSW and as such the NSW mines are considered to be one CGU. In 2017, Hunter Valley\nOperations and Mount Thorley Warkworth have been included in the NSW regional CGU alongside Moolarben and Stratford/Duralie. Yarrabee\nand Middlemount are considered separate CGUs due to location and ownership structure.\n\n\n**(b) Assessment of fair value**\nEach CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal has been determined using a discounted cash flow model over the expected life on mine (10 – 43\nyears). The fair value model adopted has been categorised as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\n\n**FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** ANNUAL REPORT **2017** **103**\n\n\nThe key assumptions in the model include:\n\n\n**Key assumptions** **Description**\n\n\nCoal prices The Group’s cash flow forecasts are based on estimates of future coal prices, which assume benchmark prices\nwill revert to the Group’s assessment of the long term real coal prices of USD 65 – USD 101 per tonne (2016:\nUSD 66 – USD 100 per tonne) for thermal and USD 110 – USD 190 per tonne (2016: USD 104 – USD 165 per\ntonne) for metallurgical coal.\n\n\nThe Group receives long term forecast coal price data from multiple external sources when determining its\nbenchmark coal price forecasts and then makes adjustments for specific coal qualities.\n\n\nFor both thermal and metallurgical coal the Group’s forecast coal price is within the range of external\nprice forecasts.\nForeign exchange rates The long term AUD/USD forecast exchange rate of $0.75 (2016: $0.73) is based on external sources. The yearend AUD/USD exchange rate was $0.78 per the Reserve Bank of Australia.\nProduction and capital costs Production and capital costs are based on the Group’s estimate of forecast geological conditions, stage of\nexisting plant and equipment and future production levels.\n\nThis information is obtained from internally maintained budgets, the five year business plan, life of mine models,\nlife of mine plans, JORC reports, and project evaluations performed by the Group in its ordinary course\nof business.\n\nCoal reserves and resources See discussion at Note C2 Mining tenements for how the coal reserves and resources are determined.\nDiscount rate The Group has applied a post-tax discount rate of 10.5% (2016: 10.5%) to discount the forecast future\nattributable post-tax cash flows.\n\nThe post-tax discount rate applied to the future cash flow forecasts represents an estimate of the rate the\nmarket would apply having regard to the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the\nfuture cash flow estimates have not been adjusted.\n\nThis rate is also consistent with the Group’s five year business plan, life of mine models and project evaluations\nperformed in ordinary course of business.\n\n\nBased on the above assumptions at 31 December 2017 the recoverable amount is determined to be above book value for all CGUs resulting in\nno further impairment.\n\n\nAt 31 December 2017, the remaining impairment provision at Moolarben of $100 million has been reversed. Management have assessed the\nfollowing as being reasons for the reversal:\n\n\n–– both the NSW CGU and Moolarben standalone recoverable amounts are above book value;\n\n–– completion of open-cut expansions and commencement of underground mining operations during 2017 have derisked future cash flows and\nincreased production from 8Mt in 2014 to approximately 17Mt of ROM coal; and\n\n\n–– current and life of mine operating costs and capital expenditure have decreased.\n\n\nThe impairment reversal has been recognised through the profit and loss.\n\n\nImpairment provision recorded as at 31 December 2017 is $73 million for Stratford and Duralie. Stratford and Duralie is included in the NSW\nregion CGU. Management may consider reversals of the impairment provision previously recognised if there is either an increase in the average\nlong term real revenue over the life of the mine due to either an increase in USD coal prices, or a further weakening of the AUD/USD foreign\nexchange rate or a combination of both, or further reductions in the current and life of mine operating costs, capital expenditure requirements, or\nan increase in the reserves.\n\n\nIn determining the value assigned to each key assumption, management has used: external sources of information; the expertise of external\nconsultants; as well as the experience of experts within the Group to validate entity specific assumptions such as coal reserves and resources.\nAdditionally various sensitivities have been determined and considered with respect to each of the key assumptions, further supporting the\nabove fair value conclusions.\n\n\n**(c) Key sensitivity**\nThe most sensitive input in the fair value model is forecast revenue, which is primarily dependent on estimated future coal prices and the AUD/\nUSD forecast exchange rate.\n\n\nIf coal prices were -10% LOM the recoverable amount would exceed book value for all CGUs with the exception of Yarrabee who exceeded the\nrecoverable amount by $15 million. If the AUD/USD long term forecast exchange rate was $0.80 the recoverable amount would exceed book\nvalue for all CGUs.\n\n\nGoodwill\n\nThe Yarrabee goodwill was not subject to an impairment charge as the recoverable amount is greater than the carrying value for this CGU.\n\n\n**104** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD **FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\n\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017\n\n\n**C – OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES**\n\n\n**C4 EXPLORATION AND EVALUATION ASSETS**\n\n\n**Accounting Policy**\nExploration and evaluation expenditure incurred is accumulated in respect of each separately identifiable area of interest which is at the\nindividual exploration permit or licence level. These costs are only carried forward where the right of tenure for the area of interest is current\nand to the extent that they are expected to be recouped through successful development and commercial exploitation, or alternatively,\nsale of the area, or where activities in the area have not yet reached a stage which permits reasonable assessment of the existence of\neconomically recoverable reserves and active and significant operations in, or in relation to, the area of interest are continuing.\n\n\nExploration and evaluation assets acquired in a business combination are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date. The carrying\namount of exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest the carrying amount of the\nassets may exceed their recoverable amount. A regular review is undertaken for each area of interest to determine the appropriateness of\ncontinuing to carry forward costs in relation to each area of interest. Accumulated costs in relation to an abandoned area are written off in\nfull in the period in which the decision to abandon the area is made.\n\n\nOnce the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the extraction of mineral resources in an area of interest are demonstrable,\nthe exploration and evaluation assets attributable to that area of interest are first tested for impairment and then reclassified to\nmining tenements.\n\n\n**Critical accounting estimates and judgements**\nThe application of the Group’s accounting policy for exploration and evaluation expenditure requires judgement in determining whether it\nis likely that future economic benefits are likely, which may be based on assumptions about future events or circumstances. Estimates and\nassumptions may change if new information becomes available. If after expenditure is capitalised information becomes available suggesting\nthat the recovery of expenditure is unlikely, the amount capitalised is written off in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other\nComprehensive Income in the period when the new information becomes available.\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n**2017**\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n**2016**\n**$M**\n\n\n\nOpening net book amount **498** 591\n\nAcquisition through business combination **108** –\n\nOther additions **3** –\n\nTransfers to mining tenements **(26)** (101)\n\nTransfers – assets under construction **–** 8\nTransfer to assets classified as held for sale **(18)** –\nClosing net book amount **565** 498\n\n\n**FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** ANNUAL REPORT **2017** **105**\n\n\n**C5 INTANGIBLES**\n\n\n**Accounting Policies**\n(i) Goodwill\nGoodwill acquired in a business combination is recognised at cost and subsequently measured at cost less any impairment losses.\nThe cost represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent\nliabilities acquired.\n\n\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.\n\n\nSee Note C3 for further details on impairment of assets.\n\n\n(ii) Computer software\nComputer software is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.

Rehabilitation of these areas is ongoing and in some cases will continue until 2060. The\nprovision for rehabilitation costs has been calculation based on the present value of the future costs expected to be\nincurred in restoring affected mining areas, assuming current technologies.\n\n\n**Key estimate and judgement:**\nThe rehabilitation provision has been created based on management’s internal estimates and assumptions relating\nto the current economic environment, which management believes is a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the\nfuture liability.\n\n\nThese estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions, however actual\nrehabilitation costs will ultimately depend upon the future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works and\nthe timing of when the rehabilitation costs are incurred. Timing is dependent upon when the mines ceases to produce at\neconomically viable rates, which in turn, will depend upon future coal prices, which are inherently uncertain.\n\nTake or pay In acquiring part of a business or operation, an assessment is made on the fair value of the assets and liabilities under\nAASB 3 Business Combinations. Take or pay is the assessment of forecast excess capacity for port and rail contracts.\nA provision was recognised for the discounted estimated excess capacity. The provision has a finite life and will be\nreleased to profit or loss over the period in which excess capacity is realised.\n\n\n**Key estimate and judgement:**\nThe provision is recognised and estimated based on management’s assessment of contracted port capacity versus\nforecast usage. This involves making assumptions about the probability, amount and timing of an outflow of resources\nembodying economic benefits.\nSales contract In acquiring part of a business or operation, an assessment is made on the fair value of the assets and liabilities under\nAASB 3 Business Combinations. The sales contract provision is the assessment of a coal supply and transportation\nagreement to supply coal to BLCP Power Limited in Thailand at below market prices. A provision was recognised for the\ndiscounted estimated variance between contract and market prices. The provision has a finite life and will be released to\nprofit or loss over the contract term.\n\n\n**Key estimate and judgement:**\nThe provision is recognised and estimated based on management’s assessment of future market prices.\nOther provisions The provision includes marketing services fee payable to Noble Group Limited deemed above market norms, contingent\nroyalties payable to Rio Tinto Plc assessed as part of the Coal & Allied acquisition in 2017 which will be amortised over\nthe contract term, and make good provisions to cover the cost to ‘make good’ any hired equipment, in case any major\noverhaul costs are incurred at the end of the lease period.\n\n\n**110** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD **FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\n\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017\n\n\n**C – OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES**\n\n\n**C11 ASSET CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE**\n\n\n**Accounting Policies**\nNon-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale or\nloss of control transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the asset (or disposal group) is\navailable for immediate sale or disposal in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales or disposals of\nsuch assets (or disposal group) and the transaction is highly probable. Management must be committed to the transaction, which should be\nexpected to qualify for recognition as a completed transaction within one year from the date of classification.\n\n\nWhen the Group is committed to a sale plan or other transaction involving loss of control of a subsidiary, all of the assets and liabilities of\nthat subsidiary are classified as held for sale when the criteria described above are met, regardless of whether the Group will retain a noncontrolling interest in its former subsidiary after the sale.\n\nNon-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their previous carrying amount and fair\nvalue less costs to sell.\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n**2017**\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n**2016**\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Current assets**\n\nInvestment in associate (i) **25** –\n\nInterest in joint ventures (ii) **531** –\n\nLand held for sale (iii) **57**\n\n**Total current assets** **613** –\n\n\n**Current liabilities**\n\nInterest in joint ventures (ii) **67** –\n\n**Total current liabilities** **67** –\n\n\n**(i) Investment in associate**\nThe investment in associate was included in the asset sale agreement with Glencore as disclosed further in Note E1.

Glencore will pay cash consideration\nof US$429 million to the Group for a 16.6% interest in HVO, and this amount is reduced by the net cash flows generated by the 16.6% HVO\ninterest from 1 September 2017 to the date of completion. The consideration will also include a 27.9% share of US$240 million of noncontingent royalties and 49% of HVO contingent royalties payable by the Group and a net debt and working capital adjustment in respect of the\nCoal & Allied acquisition.

The purchase price was\nfunded by way of a $1,363 million loan from Yancoal Australia Ltd to Watagan bearing interest of BBSY plus 7.06% with a maturity date of\n1 April 2025. The outstanding interest and principal of this loan is guaranteed by Yankuang Group Co. Ltd, the Group’s ultimate parent entity.\nWatagan can make prepayments of the outstanding loan balance with any such prepayment capable of redraw in the future.\n\n\n**D2 INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES**\n\n\n**Accounting Policies**\n(i) Interest bearing liabilities\nInterest-bearing liabilities (excluding financial guarantees) are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs. They are subsequently\nmeasured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. US dollar interest bearing loans are designated as a hedge instrument\nin a cash flow hedge (refer to note D6).\n\n\n(ii) Leases\nProperty, plant and equipment held by the Group under leases that transfer to the Group substantially all of the risks and rewards of\nownership are classified as finance leases.\n\n\nThe leased property, plant and equipment are initially measured at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present\nvalue of the minimum lease payments. Subsequently they are accounted for in accordance with the property, plant and equipment\naccounting policy.\n\n\nThe corresponding minimum lease payments are included in lease liabilities within interest bearing liabilities. Each lease payment is allocated\nbetween finance cost and a reduction in the outstanding lease liability. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so\nas to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.\n\n\nThe net gains arising on the sale of an asset and the leasing back of the same asset using a finance lease are included as deferred income\nin the balance sheet and are released to the profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n\n\n(iii) Borrowing costs\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of assets that necessarily take a substantial period of\ntime to prepare for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for\ntheir intended use or sale.\n\n\nAll other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.\n\n\n**112** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD **FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\n\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017\n\n\n**D – CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING**\n\n\n**D2 INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES (CONTINUED)**\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n**2017**\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n**2016**\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Current**\n\nSecured lease liabilities (refer to Note F1(b)) **17** 20\n\n**17** 20\n\n\n**Non-current**\n\nSecured bank loans **3,141** 3,593\n\nSecured lease liabilities (refer to Note F1(b)) **38** 47\n\nUnsecured loans from related parties **1,527** 1,290\n\n**4,706** 4,930\n\n**Total interest-bearing liabilities** **4,723** 4,950\n\n\n\n**AUD’M** **Balance** **Debt** **Debt** **Lease** **New**\n\n**Facilities** **31 Dec 2016** **drawdown** **repayment** **repayment** **Leases**\n\n\n\n**Foreign**\n**exchange** **Balance**\n**movements** **31 Dec 2017**\n\n\n\nSecured bank loan 3,593 – (196) – – (256) 3,141\n\nLoans from related parties (i) 1,290 326 – – – (89) 1,527\n\nFinance leases 67 – – (23) 9 – 55\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities **4,950** **326** **(196)** **(23)** **9** **(345)** **4,723**\n\n\n(i) Interests costs incurred on finance leases amounted to $3 million as at 31 December 2017.

The Group’s primary objectives when\nmanaging capital are to ensure the continued ability to provide a consistent return for equity stakeholders through a combination of capital\ngrowth and distributions and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. In order to achieve these objectives, the\nGroup seeks to maintain a debt to debt plus equity ratio (gearing ratio) that balances risks and returns at an acceptable level and also to\nmaintain a sufficient funding base to enable the Group to meet its working capital and strategic investment needs. In order to maintain or adjust\nthe capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or\nother equity instruments, repay debt or draw down additional debt.\n\n\nThe gearing ratios at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 were as follows:\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n**2016**\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Notes**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n**2017**\n**$M**\n\n\n\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities D2 **4,723** 4,951\nLess: cash and cash equivalents C6 **(207)** (190)\n\nNet debt **4,516** 4,761\n\n\nTotal equity **5,026** 1,351\n\nTotal capital **9,542** 6,112\n\n\nGearing ratio **47.3%** 77.9%\n\n\nRefer to Note D2 for the Group’s compliance with the financial covenants of its borrowing facilities.\n\n\n**116** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD **FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\n\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017\n\n\n**D – CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING**\n\n\n**D5 DISTRIBUTIONS**\n\n\n**(a) SCN distributions**\n\n\n**2017** **2016**\n\n**%** **Total** **Total** **%** **Total** **Total**\n**per SCN** **US$’M** **AU$’M** **per SCN** **US$’M** **AU$’M**\n\n\nInterim distribution paid on 31 July 2017 (2016 paid 29 July 2016) **7%** **63** **79** 7% 63 84\n\nFinal distribution to be accrued as at 31 December 2017\n(31 December 2016 accrual, paid on 31 January 2017) **7%** **–** **–** 7% 63 87\n\n**63** **79** 126 171\n\n\nNo accrual was made as at 31 December 2017 for the distribution on 31 January 2018 as the Yancoal SCN Ltd Board had not approved the\ndistribution as at 31 December 2017.

Glencore will also pay to Yancoal 27.9% of the\nUS$240 million in future non-contingent royalty payments and 49% of\nthe coal price linked contingent royalty payments associated with HVO\nthat are payable by Yancoal to Rio Tinto Limited for the Acquisition.\n\n\nThe Transaction is subject to a number of conditions precedent,\nincluding Glencore obtaining all necessary regulatory approvals,\nincluding final competition clearance from Japan. Should the\nconditions precedent not be satisfied then Yancoal would need to pay\nHVOR US$710 million to acquire its 32.4% interest in HVO.\n\n\n(v) Other contingencies\nA number of claims have been made against the Group, including in\nrespect of personal injuries, and in relation to contracts which Group\nmembers are party to as part of the Group’s day to day operations.\nThe personal injury claims which have been made against the Group\nhave largely been assumed by the insurers of the Group under the\nGroup’s insurance policies. The Directors do not believe that the\noutcome of these claims will have a material impact on the Group’s\nfinancial position.\n\n\n**D8 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT**\n\nThe Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market\nrisk (including foreign exchange risk, price risk and interest rate risk),\ncredit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management\nprogram focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets\nand seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial\nperformance of the Group. The Group uses derivative financial\ninstruments such as foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain risk\nexposures. Derivatives are exclusively used for hedging purposes and\nnot as speculative instruments. The Group uses different methods to\nmeasure different types of risk to which it is exposed. These methods\ninclude sensitivity analysis in the case of foreign exchange, interest\nrate risk and other price risks, and aging analysis for credit risk.\n\n\nThe Group holds the following financial instruments:\n\n\n(i) Cash and cash equivalents;\n\n\n(ii) Trade and other receivables;\n\n\n(iii) Trade and other payables;\n\n(iv) Interest-bearing liabilities, including bank loans and finance leases;\n\n\n(v) Available-for-sale investments;\n\n\n(vi) Royalty receivable;\n\n(vii) Derivative financial instruments; and\n\n\n(viii) Interest-bearing loan from associate.\n\n\n\nThe Board of Directors has overall responsibility for determining risk\nmanagement objectives and policies and risk management is carried\nout by the Group Audit and Risk Management department along with\nthe Group Treasury department. The Board provides written principles\nfor overall risk management, as well as policies covering specific areas\nsuch as the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate foreign\nexchange risk. These derivative instruments create an obligation or\nright that effectively transfers one or more of the risks associated with\nan underlying financial instrument, asset or obligation.\n\n\nThe overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce\nrisk and volatility in financial performance without unduly affecting\ncompetitiveness and flexibility. Further details regarding these policies\nare set out below.\n\n\n**(a) Market risk**\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as\nforeign exchange rates, interest rates, securities prices, and coal\nprices, will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of\nfinancial instruments.\n\n\n(i) Foreign exchange risk\nThe Group operates entirely in Australia and its costs are primarily\ndenominated in its functional currency, the Australian dollar. Export\ncoal sales are denominated in US dollars and a strengthening of\nthe Australian dollar against the US dollar has an adverse impact\non earnings and cash flow settlement. Liabilities for some plant and\nequipment purchases and loans are denominated in currencies other\nthan the Australian dollar and a weakening of the Australian dollar\nagainst other currencies has an adverse impact on earnings and cash\nflow settlement.\n\n\nThe hedging policy of the Group aims to protect against the volatility\nof cash expenditures or reduced collection in the above mentioned\ntransactions as well as to reduce the volatility of profit or loss for\nretranslation of US dollar denominated loans at each period end.\n\n\n_Hedging through bank issued instruments_\nOperating foreign exchange risk that arises from firm commitments\nor highly probable transactions are managed through the use of bank\nissued forward foreign currency contracts and collar option contracts.\nThe Group hedges a portion of contracted US dollar sales and asset\npurchases settled in foreign currencies in each currency to mitigate\nthe adverse impact on cash flow due to the future rise or fall in\nAustralian dollars against the relevant currencies.\n\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are\ndesignated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in Other\nComprehensive Income in the hedging reserve until the anticipated\nunderlying transaction occurs. Once the anticipated underlying\ntransaction occurs, amounts accumulated in equity are recycled\nthrough the profit or loss or recognised as part of the cost of the asset\nto which it relates. The ineffective portion of changes in the fair value\nof derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is\nrecognised immediately in the profit or loss. In the current period, the\nloss relating to the ineffective portion was $nil (2016: $nil).\n\n\n**FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** ANNUAL REPORT **2017** **119**\n\n\n_Natural cash flow hedge_\nThe Group currently does not use bank issued instruments to hedge foreign exchange risks in respect of US dollar denominated loans, however,\nthe scheduled repayment of the principal on US dollar loans is designated to hedge the cash flow risks on the portion of forecast US dollar\nsales that are not hedged through bank issued instruments (“natural cash flow hedge”). US dollar loan repayments up to a six-month period are\ndesignated to hedge the forecast US dollar sales during the same period after the designation of the hedge relationship based on a dollar for\ndollar basis until the hedge ratio reaches one.\n\n\nHedging effectiveness is determined by comparing the changes in the hedging instruments and hedged sales. Hedge ineffectiveness will occur\nwhen cash flows generated by sales transactions are lower than the forecast sales transaction. In cases of hedge ineffectiveness, gains or\nlosses in relation to the excess portion in the foreign exchange movement of the designated US dollar loan repayment will be recycled to profit\nor loss. The effective portion of changes in the hedging instruments will be recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve in Other Comprehensive\nIncome. When the sales transactions occur, amounts accumulated in equity are recycled through the profit or loss as an increase or decrease to\nsales revenue.\n\n\n_Royalty receivable_\nThe royalty receivable from the Middlemount Joint Venture is estimated based on expected future cash flows that are dependent on sales\nvolumes, US dollar denominated coal prices and the US dollar foreign exchange rate (refer to Note C9).\n\n\n_Other assets_\n\nOther assets include the US$10 million associated with the Warkworth Call Option expected to complete in March 2018, and the promissory\nnote receivable as discussed in Note C7(i). These balances are predominantly held in US dollars and expected to settle within 12 months.\n\n\n_Non-contingent royalty payable_\nAs discussed in Note E1 the Company has agreed to make deferred non-contingent royalty payments to Rio Tinto Plc (“Rio Tinto”) in US dollars.\n\n\nThe Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk at the end of the reporting period, expressed in Australian dollars, was as follows:\n\n\n**31 December 2017** **31 December 2016**\n\n**USD** **RMB*** **USD** **RMB***\n**$M** **$M** **$M** **$M**\n\n\nCash and cash equivalents **139** **–** 124 1\n\nTrade receivables **432** **–** 165 –\n\nOther assets **49** **–** – –\n\nRoyalty receivable **199** **–** 199 –\n\n**–** –\nTrade and other payables **(249)** (157)\n\n**–** –\nInterest bearing liabilities **(4,668)** (4,883)\nNon-contingent royalty payable **(167)** **–** (1) –\nNet Exposure **(4,265)** **–** (4,553) 1\n\n\n- The cash and cash equivalents balance in RMB was $1.6 million on 18 January 2018. No foreign exchange risk for sensitivity analysis has been performed in 2017 due to\nthe immaterial position subsequent to year end.\n\n\n_Sensitivity_\nThe following table summarises the sensitivity of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities to a reasonable possible change in the US dollar\nexchange rate. The Group’s exposure to other foreign exchange movements is not material. The Group has used the observed range of actual\nhistorical rates for the preceding five year period, with a heavier weighting placed on recently observed market data, in determining reasonably\npossible exchange movements to be used for the current year’s sensitivity analysis. Past movements are not necessarily indicative of future\nmovements. A 10% depreciation/appreciation of the Australian dollar against the US dollar would have (decreased)/increased equity and profit or\nloss after tax by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.\n\n\n**120** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD **FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\n\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017\n\n\n**D – CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING**\n\n\n**D8 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)**\n\n\n**(a) Market risk (continued)**\n(i) Foreign exchange risk (continued)\n\n\n**10% depreciation of** **10% appreciation of**\n**AUD/USD** **AUD/USD**\n**Profit after** **Profit after**\n**income tax** **Equity** **income tax** **Equity**\n**$M** **$M** **$M** **$M**\n\n\n**2017**\n\nCash and cash equivalents **11** **–** **(9)** **–**\n\nTrade and other receivables **34** **–** **(28)** **–**\n\nRoyalty receivable **15** **–** **(18)** **–**\n\nOther assets **4** **–** **(38)** **–**\nTotal increase/(decrease) in financial assets **64** **–** **(93)** **–**\n\n\nTrade and other payables **(19)** **–** **26** **–**\nInterest-bearing liabilities **–** **(363)** **–** **297**\nNon-contingent royalty payable **(13)** **–** **11** **–**\nTotal (increase)/decrease in financial liabilities **(32)** **(363)** **37** **297**\nTotal increase/(decrease) in profit after tax and equity **32** **(363)** **(56)** **297**\n\n\n**2016**\n\nCash and cash equivalents 10 – (8) –\n\nTrade and other receivables 13 – (11) –\n\nRoyalty receivable 16 – (12) –\nTotal increase/(decrease) in financial assets 39 – (31) –\n\n\nTrade and other payables (12) – 10 –\nInterest-bearing liabilities – (380) – 311\nDerivative financial instrument (7) – 6 –\nTotal (increase)/decrease in financial liabilities (19) (380) 16 311\nTotal increase/(decrease) in profit after tax and equity 20 (380) (15) 311\n\n\nEquity movements above reflect movements in the hedge reserve due to foreign exchange movements on USD interest bearing loans.\n\n\n(ii) Price risk\nThe price risk of the Group include coal price risk.\n\n\nThe Group does not enter into commodity contracts other than to meet the Group’s expected usage and sales requirements, such contracts\nare not settled net.

Generally, no variable\ninterest is receivable or payable on the Group’s trade and other receivables or payables where applicable as they are fixed in nature and therefore\nthey are not exposed to the interest rate risk.\n\n\nThe Group’s cash flow interest rate risk for assets primarily arises from cash at bank and deposits subject to market bank rates. Floating rate\nborrowings bearing LIBOR rates are re-set on a quarterly basis.\n\n\nThe Group’s exposure to interest rate risk and the weighted average interest rate is set out as below:\n\n\n**31 December 2017** **31 December 2016**\n\n**Weighted** **Weighted**\n\n**average** **average**\n**interest rate** **Balance** **interest rate** **Balance**\n**%** **$M** **%** **$M**\n\n\nCash and cash equivalents **1.3** **207** 0.5 190\n\nRestricted cash **3.0** **1** 2.1 29\n\nBank loans and other borrowings **5.0** **3,141** 4.4 3,593\nNet exposure to cash flow interest rate risk **3,349** 3,812\n\n\n_Sensitivity_\nThe following table summarises the sensitivity of the Group’s significant financial assets and liabilities to changes in variable interest rates.

Past movements are not necessarily indicative of future movements. For\nfinancial assets, a 25 basis point (decrease)/increase in interest rates would have (decreased)/increased equity and profit or loss after tax by the\namounts shown below.

Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, favourable derivative financial instruments and\ndeposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to wholesale and retail customers, including outstanding receivables\nand committed transactions. For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of ‘A’ are accepted. If\nwholesale customers are independently rated, these ratings are used. Otherwise, if there is no independent rating, the marketing department\nassesses the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors.\n\n\nCredit risk in trade receivables is managed in the following ways:\n\n\n(i) payment terms and credit limits are set for individual customers;\n\n\n(ii) a risk assessment process is used for all customers; and\n\n\n(iii) letters of credit are required for those customers assessed as posing a higher risk.\n\n\nThe maximum exposure to credit risk on financial assets which have been recognised in the balance sheet is their carrying amount less\nimpairment provision, if any as set out below.\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n**2017**\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n**2016**\n**$M**\n\n\n\nCash and cash equivalents **207** 222\n\nTrade and other receivables **1,131** 842\n\n**1,338** 1,064\n\n\nIncluded in trade and other receivables are significant customers located in Singapore, Japan, Australia, and Hong Kong that account for 30%,\n23%, 14% and 8% of trade receivables respectively (2016: Australia 46%, Singapore 22%, South Korea 7% and China 4%).\n\n\nAt 31 December 2017, no derivative financial instruments were outstanding (2016: net liability position). As a result no credit risk has been\ndisclosed above.\n\n\n**(c) Liquidity risk**\nLiquidity risk includes the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group will be impacted in the\nfollowing ways:\n\n(i) will not have sufficient funds to settle transactions on the due date;\n\n(ii) will be forced to sell financial assets at a value which is less than what they are worth; or\n\n(iii) may be unable to settle or recover a financial asset at all.\n\n\nLiquidity risk is managed by maintaining sufficient cash and liquid deposit balances and having readily accessible standby facilities in place in\naccordance with the Board’s risk management policy. Details regarding finance facilities are set out in Note D2.\n\n\n**Maturities of financial liabilities**\nThe tables below analyse the Group’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on their contractual maturities for:\n\n(a) all non-derivative financial liabilities, and\n\n(b) net and gross settled derivative financial instruments for which the contractual maturities are essential for an understanding of the timing of\nthe cash flows.\n\n\nThe amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows including interest payments.

AASB 13 _Fair Value Measurement_ requires disclosure of fair\nvalue measurements by level in accordance with the following fair value measurement hierarchy:\n\n\n(a) quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1);\n\n\n(b) inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly\n(derived from prices) (level 2); and\n\n\n(c) inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) (level 3).\n\n\nThe following table presents the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities measured and recognised at fair value at 31 December 2017 and\n31 December 2016:\n\n\n**Level 1** **Level 2** **Level 3** **Total**\n**$M** **$M** **$M** **$M**\n\n\n**31 December 2017**\n\n**Assets**\n\nRoyalty receivable **–** **–** **199** **199**\n\n**Total assets** **–** **–** **199** **199**\n\n\n**Liabilities**\n\n**Total liabilities** **–** **–** **–** **–**\n\n\n**31 December 2016**\n\n**Assets**\n\nRoyalty receivable – – 199 199\n\n**Total assets** – – 199 199\n\n\n**Liabilities**\n\nDerivatives used for hedging\n\nForward foreign exchange contracts – 1 – 1\n\nOther derivatives – – – –\n\n**Total liabilities** – 1 – 1\n\n\n**124** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD **FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\n\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017\n\n\n**D – CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING**\n\n\n**D8 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)**\n\n\n**(d) Fair value measurements (continued)**\n(ii) Valuation techniques\nThe fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation techniques. These valuation\ntechniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are\nobservable, the instrument is included in level 2.\n\n\nIf one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. This is the case for the\nroyalty receivable.\n\n\nThe valuation techniques used for level 2 financial instruments are:\n\n\n**Description** **Valuation Technique(s)** **Inputs used**\n\nForward Foreign Exchange Contracts Income approach using discount cash flow Current forward exchange rates applicable to\nmethodology remaining life of contract\n\n\n(iii) Fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (level 3)\nThe following table presents the changes in level 3 instruments for the year ended 31 December 2017:\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n**2017**\n\n**Royalty**\n**Receivable**\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n**2016**\n\n**Royalty**\n**Receivable**\n**$M**\n\n\n\nOpening balance **199** 205\nCash received/receivable **(29)** (21)\n\nUnwinding of the discount **21** 21\nRemeasurement of the royalty receivable recognised in profit and loss **8** (6)\nClosing balance **199** 199\n\n\n_Royalty receivable_\nThe fair value of the royalty receivable is the fair value of the right to receive a royalty of 4% of Free on Board Trimmed Sales from the\nMiddlemount Mine. The financial asset has a finite life being the life of the Middlemount Mine and will be measured on a fair value basis.\n\n\nThe fair value is determined using the discounted future cash flows that are dependent on the following unobservable inputs: forecast sales\nvolumes, coal prices and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The forecast sales volumes are based on the internally maintained budgets, five\nyear business plan and life of mine models. The forecast coal prices and long term exchange rates are based on external data consistent with\nthe data used for impairment assessments (refer to Note C3). The risk-adjusted post-tax discount rate used to determine the future cash flows\nis 10%.\n\n\nThe estimated fair value could increase significantly if the following unobservable inputs of sales volumes and coal prices were higher and if the\nAustralian dollar weakens against the US dollar. The estimated fair value would also increase if the risk-adjusted discount rate was lower.\n\n\n(iv) Fair values of other financial instruments\nThe carrying amount is approximate to the fair value for the following:\n\n\n(i) Trade and other receivables\n\n(ii) Other financial assets\n\n\n(iii) Trade and other payables\n\n\n(iv) Interest-bearing liabilities\n\n\n**FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** ANNUAL REPORT **2017** **125**\n\n\n**E – GROUP STRUCTURE**\n\n\nThis section explains significant aspects of the Group’s structure including interests in other entities, related party transactions, parent entity\ninformation, controlled entities and the deed of cross guarantee.\n\n\n**E1 ACQUISITION OF COAL & ALLIED**\n\n\n**Accounting Policies**\nThe acquisition method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations, including business combinations involving entities\nor businesses under common control, regardless of whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired. The consideration transferred\nfor the acquisition of a subsidiary comprises the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by\nthe Group. The consideration transferred also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration arrangement and the fair value of any\npre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary. Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred with the exception of stamp duty. Identifiable\nassets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at\ntheir fair values at the acquisition date.\n\n\nThe excess of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition date fair value\nof any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets acquired is recorded as\ngoodwill. If those amounts are less than the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the subsidiary acquired and the measurement of all\namounts has been reviewed, the difference is recognised directly in profit or loss as a gain on acquisition of subsidiaries.\n\n\n**Critical accounting estimates and judgements**\nAcquisition accounting\nAccounting for acquisition of businesses requires judgement and estimates in determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities.\nTechniques used to determine the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities include an income & cost approach for mining tenements and\ndepreciated replacement cost for the valuation of property, plant and equipment.\n\n\nThe relevant accounting standard allows the fair value of assets acquired to be refined for a window of one year after the acquisition date,\nand judgement is required to ensure the adjustments made reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed\nas of the acquisition date. The adjustments made on fair value of assets are retrospective in nature and have an impact on goodwill or gain\nrecognised on acquisition.\n\n\n**Acquisition of Coal & Allied**\n(a) Summary of acquisition\nAs announced on 24 January 2017 and as subsequently amended on 26 June 2017, the Company entered into a binding agreement to acquire\n100% of the shares in Coal & Allied from wholly owned subsidiaries of Rio Tinto for US$2.69 billion plus an adjustment for net debt and working\ncapital. US$2.45 billion was paid on completion, plus US$240 million in non-contingent royalty payments over five years from completion. The\nAcquisition completed on 1 September 2017 resulting in the Company acquiring (through its ownership of the shares in Coal & Allied) Rio Tinto’s\ninterest in the Hunter Valley Operations (HVO) and Mount Thorley Warkworth (MTW) mines (an integrated operation of two open-cut mines\nlocated adjacent to each other in the Hunter Valley, NSW), a 36.5% interest in PWCS (the owner of a coal export terminal located at the Port of\nNewcastle), as well as other coal exploration projects and landholdings.\n\n\n(b) Transaction funding and capital structure simplification\nOn 31 August funding for the acquisition of Coal & Allied was achieved by the Company successfully completing the issue of new fully paid\nordinary shares (“New Shares”) under the pro-rata renounceable entitlement offer (“Entitlement Offer”) and institutional placement (“Placement”)\nannounced to ASX on 1 August 2017. New Shares under the Entitlement Offer and Placement were issued at the offer price of US$0.10\n(“Offer Price”).\n\n\nYancoal issued:\n\n\n–– 23,464,929,520 New Shares under the Entitlement Offer, raising gross proceeds of US$2,346,492,952; and\n\n–– 1,500,000,000 New Shares under the Placement, raising gross proceeds of US$150,000,000.\n\n\nIn addition, the Company issued 18,000,031,000 New Shares to Yanzhou Coal Mining Co., Ltd (“Yanzhou”) on conversion of all of its\nsubordinated capital notes (“SCN”) at a conversion price of US$0.10 per New Share, in accordance with the SCN terms of issue. Yancoal has\nalso issued a further 150,943 New Shares on conversion of 80 other SCNs for which a conversion notice was received, at a conversion price of\nUS$0.053 per New Share, in accordance with the SCN terms of issue.\n\n\n**126** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD **FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\n\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017\n\n\n**E – GROUP STRUCTURE**\n\n\n**E1 ACQUISITION OF COAL & ALLIED (CONTINUED)**\n\n\n(c) Assets and liabilities acquired\nDetails of the purchase consideration, the net assets and liabilities acquired and gain on acquisition of subsidiaries are as follows:\n\n\n**$M**\n\n\nPurchase consideration (refer to (c) below):\n\nAcquisition price **3,102**\n\nNon-contingent royalty **283**\n\nNet debt and working capital adjustment **162**\n\nTotal consideration **3,547**\n\n\nGain on acquisition of subsidiaries **177**\n\nFair value of net identifiable assets acquired (refer to (i) below) **3,724**\n\n\n_(i) Assets and liabilities acquired_\nThe assets and liabilities recognised as a result of the acquisition are as follows:\n\n\n**Fair value**\n**$M**\n\n\nCash **152**\n\nTrade receivables **135**\n\nInventories **79**\nAssets classified as held for sale **82**\n\nOther assets **60**\n\nInvestments in associates **197**\n\nPlant and equipment **1,326**\n\nMining tenements **2,456**\n\nExploration and evaluation assets **108**\n\nIntangible assets **35**\n\nDeferred tax asset **105**\n\nTrade and other payables **(303)**\n\nOther liabilities **(2)**\n\nProvisions **(436)**\n\nDeferred tax liabilities **(270)**\nFair value of net identifiable assets acquired **3,724**\n\n\nThe accounting for the acquisition has been determined on a provisional basis at 31 December 2017. Any adjustments to the provisional values\nas a result of completing work on the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired will be recognised within 12 months of the acquisition date and\nwill be recognised as if they had occurred as at the date of acquisition.\n\n\nThe preliminary assessment of the contingent royalty included in the entitlement offer booklet was that it formed part of the purchase\nconsideration. Having performed a more detailed assessment it has been determined the contingent royalty obligation represents a liability of the\nacquired group as it is payable by subsidiaries of Coal & Allied and is included in provisions above.\n\n\n_(ii) Gain on acquisition of subsidiaries_\nThe Company recognised a gain on acquisition of $177 million in other income in the profit and loss for the year ended 31 December 2017.\n\n\nThe acquisition resulted in a gain due to the fair value of the mine assets acquired benefiting from improved valuation assumptions on completion\ndate compared to the date the acquisition price was struck.\n\n\n_(iii) Revenue and profit contribution_\nThe acquired interest contributed revenue of $749 million and net profit of $215 million to the Group for the period from 1 September 2017 to\n31 December 2017. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2017, consolidated revenue and net profit for the period ended 31 December\n2017 would have been $2,173 million and $818 million respectively. These amounts have been calculated using the Group’s accounting policies.\n\n\n**FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** ANNUAL REPORT **2017** **127**\n\n\n**E2 INTERESTS IN OTHER ENTITIES**\n\n\n**Accounting Policies**\n(i) Associates\nAssociates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control or joint control, generally accompanying a\nshareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of\naccounting, after initially being recognised at cost. The Group’s investments in associates includes goodwill identified on acquisition.\n\n\nThe Group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in profit or loss, and its share of post-acquisition other\ncomprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against\nthe carrying amount of the investment. Dividends receivable from associates are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of\nthe investment.\n\n\n(ii) Joint arrangements\nA joint arrangement is a contractual arrangement whereby two or more parties undertake economic activities under joint control. Joint\ncontrol exists only when the strategic, financial and operational policy decisions relating to the activities of the joint arrangement require the\nunanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\n\nA joint arrangement is either a joint operation or a joint venture. The structure of each joint arrangement is analysed to determine whether\nthe joint arrangement is a joint operation or a joint venture. The classification of a joint arrangement is dependent on the rights and\nobligations of the parties to the arrangement.\n\n\n_Joint operations_\nThe Group recognises its proportional right to the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations and its share of any\njointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These have been incorporated in the financial statements under the\nappropriate headings.\n\n\n_Joint ventures_\n\nA joint venture is structured through a separate vehicle and the parties have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Joint ventures are\naccounted for using the equity method where the assets and liabilities will be aggregated into one line item on the face of the consolidated\nbalance sheet, after adjusting for the share of profit or loss after tax, which is shown as a separate line item on the face of the Consolidated\nStatement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income, after adjusting for amounts recognised directly in equity.\n\n\nWhen the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the joint venture (which includes any long-term interests\nthat, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the joint venture), the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has\nincurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.\n\n\nUnrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the\njoint ventures. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.\nAccounting policies of the joint ventures have been changed where necessary, to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by\nthe Group.\n\n\n**Critical accounting estimates and judgements**\nThere is significant judgement in assessing whether the Group controls Watagan. Even though it holds 100% of the nominal share capital.\nAn assessment has been made that in accordance with the accounting standards the Group does not control Watagan as it is not able to\ndirect the relevant activities of Watagan and accounts for its interest in Watagan as an associate.\n\n\n**128** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD **FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\n\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017\n\n\n**E – GROUP STRUCTURE**\n\n\n**E2 INTERESTS IN OTHER ENTITIES (CONTINUED)**\n\n\n**(a) Joint operations**\nA controlled entity, Moolarben Coal Mines Pty Limited, has an 81% interest in the Moolarben Joint Venture whose principal activity is the\ndevelopment and operation of open-cut and underground coal mines.\n\n\nA controlled entity, Coal & Allied Operations Pty Ltd has a 67.6% interest in the Hunter Valley Operations Joint Venture whose principal activity is\nthe development and operation of open-cut coal mines.\n\n\nA controlled entity, Mount Thorley Pty Ltd has an 80% interest in the Mount Thorley Joint Venture whose principal activity is the development and\noperation of open-cut coal mines.\n\n\nControlled entities, CNA Workworth Associates Pty Ltd and CNA Resources Ltd, have a combined 55.6% interest in the Workworth Joint\nVenture whose principal activity is the development and operation of open-cut mines.\n\n\nA controlled entity, Yarrabee Coal Company Pty.

The Group has the right to appoint a\ndirector and is currently represented on the Board to partake in policy-making processes.\n\n\n_Watagan Mining Company Pty Ltd_\nDuring 2015 the Group established a 100% owned subsidiary, Watagan Mining Company Pty Ltd (“Watagan”). On 18 February 2016, the\nGroup executed a Bond Subscription Agreement, together with other agreements (the “Watagan Agreements”) that, on completion, transferred\nthe Group’s interest in three of its 100% owned NSW coal mining operations, being the Austar, Ashton and Donaldson coal mines (the “three\nmines”), to Watagan for a purchase price of $1,363.4 million (an amount equal to the book value of the three mines at completion). The purchase\nprice was funded by way of a $1,363.4 million loan from Yancoal Australia Ltd to Watagan bearing interest at BBSY plus 7.06% with a maturity\ndate of 1 April 2025. The outstanding interest and principal of this loan is guaranteed by Yankuang Group Co., Ltd (“Yankuang”), the Group’s\nultimate parent entity. The completion date of the transaction was 31 March 2016.\n\n\nOn completion Watagan issued US$775 million of secured debt bonds with a term of approximately nine years to three external financiers\n(“Bondholders”). The Bondholders will receive interest on the face value outstanding on the bonds comprising a fixed interest component, as\nwell as a variable interest component that is tied to the EBITDA performance of Watagan. Under the terms of the Watagan Agreements, it was\ndetermined that upon issuance of the bonds the Group lost control of Watagan.\n\n\nThis loss of control was determined to occur on the issuance date of the bonds on the basis that the power over the key operating and strategic\ndecisions of Watagan no longer reside with the Group. Specifically, those powers were transferred to the Bondholders under the terms of the\nWatagan Agreements as the Bondholders were given control of Watagan’s board of directors via appointment of the majority of directors. This\nloss of control resulted in the Group de-consolidating the consolidated results of Watagan from the transaction completion date and the Group\nbegan to equity account for its 100% equity interest in Watagan as an associate.\n\n\nWhile Watagan is deconsolidated for accounting purposes, as a result of the Group’s ongoing 100% equity ownership it remains within the\nGroup’s tax consolidated group.\n\n\n**FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** ANNUAL REPORT **2017** **129**\n\n\n_Port Waratah Coal Services Ltd_\n\nThe Group holds a direct shareholding in Port Waratah Coal Services Ltd (“PWCS”) and also an indirect shareholding through Newcastle Coal\nShippers Pty Ltd totaling 36.5% (2016: nil) of the ordinary shares of PWCS. Under the shareholder agreement between the Group and other\nshareholders, the Group has 36.5% of the voting power of PWCS.

Income and expense items are translated\nat the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates\nfluctuated significantly during that period, in which case the exchange\nrates at the dates of the transactions are used. Exchange differences\narising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and\naccumulated in equity.\n\n\n(ii) Transactions and balances\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional\ncurrency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the\ntransactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the\nsettlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end\nexchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in\nforeign currencies are recognised in profit or loss, except when they\nare deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges.\n\n\nNon-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign\ncurrency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when\nthe fair value was determined. Translation differences on assets and\nliabilities carried at fair value are reported as part of the fair value gain\nor loss. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical\ncost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at\nthe date of the transaction.\n\n\n\n**F6 NEW AND AMENDED STANDARDS ADOPTED BY THE GROUP**\n\n\nThe Group was not required to change any of its accounting\npolicies as the result of new or revised accounting standards which\nbecame effective for the annual reporting period commencing on\n1 January 2017.\n\n\nThe new standards that are applicable to for the first time for the year\nended 31 December 2017 are:\n\n\nAASB 1057 – Application of Australian Accounting Standards\n\n\nAASB 2014 – 4 – Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards\n– Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation\nand Amortisation\n\n\nAASB 2014 – 9 – Equity Accounting in Separate Financial Statements\n\n\nAASB 2014 –10 – Sale or Contribution of Assets between An Investor\n\nand its Associate or Joint Venture\n\n\nAASB 2015 – 1 – Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards\n– Annual Improvements to Australian Accounting Standards\n2012-2014 Cycle\n\n\nAASB 2015 – 3 – Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards\narising from the Withdrawal of AASB 1031 Materiality\n\n\nAASB 2015 – 4 – Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards\n– Financial Reporting Requirements for Australian Groups with a\nForeign Parent\n\n\nAASB 2015 – 5 – Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards\n– Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception\n\n\nAASB 2015 – 9 – Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards\n– Scope and Application Paragraphs\n\n\nThese standards have introduced new disclosures for the Annual\nFinancial Report but did not affect the Group’s accounting policies or\nany of the amounts recognised in the financial statements.\n\n\n**FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** ANNUAL REPORT **2017** **143**\n\n\n**F7 NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS**\n\n\nCertain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for 31 December 2017 reporting periods and\nhave not been early adopted by the Group. The Group’s assessment of the impact of these new standards and interpretations is set out below.\n\n\n**Application date**\n**Reference and Title** **Details of New Standard/Amendment/Interpretation** **for the Group**\n\n\n\nAASB 9 _Financial Instruments_\nAmends the requirements for classification and measurement of financial assets. The available-for-sale\nand held-to-maturity categories of financial assets in AASB 139 have been eliminated. Under AASB 9,\nthere are three categories of financial assets:\n\n\na) Amortised cost\n\nb) Fair value through profit or loss\n\n\nc) Fair value through other comprehensive income\n\n\nThe standard introduces an ‘expected credit loss’ model for the measurement of the impairment of\nfinancial assets, so it is no longer necessary for a credit event to have occurred before a credit loss\nis recognised.\n\n\nThe following requirements have generally been carried forward unchanged from AASB 139 Financial\nInstruments: Recognition and Measurement into AASB 9:\n\na) Classification and measurement of financial liabilities; and\n\nb) Derecognition requirements for financial assets and liabilities\n\n\n\n1 January 2018\n\n\n\nHowever, AASB 9 requires that gains or losses on financial liabilities measured at fair value are recognised\nin profit or loss, except that the effects of changes in the liability’s credit risk are recognised in other\ncomprehensive income.\n\n\n_Impact:_\n\n\nThe Directors anticipate that the adoption of AASB 9 will have no impact on the recognition of amounts\nin the Group’s financial statements, including hedging activity, it is impracticable at this stage to provide a\nreasonable estimate of such impact, but there will be additional disclosures required.\n\n\n\nAASB 16 _Leases_\n\nThis standard introduces a single lessee accounting model that eliminates the requirement for leases to\nbe classified as operating or finance leases.\n\n\nThe main changes introduced by the new standard include:\n\n\n\n1 January 2019\n\n\n\na) Recognition of a right-to-use asset and liability for all leases (excluding short term leases with less than\n12 months of tenure an leases relating to low value assets);\n\nb) Deprecation of right-to-use assets in-line with AASB 116 Property, plant and equipment in profit or\nloss and unwinding of the liability in principal and interest components;\n\n\nc) Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate are included in the initial measurement of\nthe lease liability using the index or rate at the commencement date;\n\n\nd) By applying a practical expedient, a lessee is permitted to elect not to separate non-lease components\nand instead account all components as a lease; and\n\n\ne) Additional disclosure requirements.\n\n\n_Impact:_\n\nAlthough the Directors anticipate that the adoption of AASB 16 will impact the Group’s financial\nstatements, it is impracticable at this stage to provide a reasonable estimate of such impact.\n\n\n\nAASB 15 _Revenue from Contracts with Customers_\n\nAn entity will recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers\nin an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange\nfor those goods or services. This means that revenue will be recognised when control of goods or\nservices is transferred, rather than on transfer of risks and rewards as is currently the case under AASB\n118 Revenue.\n\n\n_Impact:_\n\n\nThe Directors anticipate that the adoption of AASB 15 will have no impact on the recognition of amounts\nin the Group’s financial statements, but there will be additional disclosures required.\n\n\n\n1 January 2018\n\n\n**144** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD **FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)**\n\n\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017\n\n\n**F – OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n\n**Application date**\n**Reference and Title** **Details of New Standard/Amendment/Interpretation** **for the Group**\n\nAASB 2014-1 _Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards (Part E)_ 1 January 2018\nPart E of this Standard defers the application date of AASB 9: Financial Instruments (December 2010)\nto annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.

The\nremaining gain or loss should be eliminated against the carrying amount of the remaining investment.\n\n\nThe application of AASB 2014-10 will result in a change in accounting policies for transactions of loss of\ncontrol over subsidiaries (involving an associate or joint venture) that are businesses per AASB 3 for which\ngains or losses were previously recognised only to the extent of the unrelated investor’s interest.\n\n\n_Impact:_\n\n\nThe Group is currently adhering to this standard and there is no material impact expected on the Group’s\nfinancial report.\n\n\n\nAASB 2016-5 _Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Classification and_\n_Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions_\nThis standard provides guidance on treatment of vesting conditions in a cash-settled share based\npayment arrangement that are similar to what has been prescribed for equity settled share based\npayment arrangements. It also clarifies that, subject to certain exceptions, share based payment\ntransactions with net-settlement feature on account of withholding tax obligations should be classified in\nentirety as equity settled share based payment.\n\n\n_Impact:_\n\n\nSince the Group does not have a policy of cash-settled share based awards or net-settlement features in\nequity settled plans, this standard is not expected to impact the Group’s financial statements.\n\nAASB _Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration_\nInterpretation 22 The amendment to AASB 107 introduces additional disclosures that will enable users of financial\nstatements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities. The amendment requires\ndisclosure of changes arising from:\n\n–– cash flows, such as drawdowns and repayments of borrowings, and\n\n\n–– non-cash changes, such as acquisitions, disposals and unrealised exchange differences.\n\n\n_Impact:_\n\n\nThe Group is currently adhering to this standard and there is no material impact expected on the Group’s\nfinancial report.\n\n\n\n1 January 2018\n\n\n1 January 2018\n\n\n**FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** ANNUAL REPORT **2017** **145**\n\n\n**Application date**\n**Reference and Title** **Details of New Standard/Amendment/Interpretation** **for the Group**\n\nAASB 2017-6 _Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Prepayment_ 1 January 2019\n_Features with Negative Compensation_\nThis Standard amends AASB 9 Financial Instruments to permit entities to measure at amortised cost\nor fair value through other comprehensive income particular financial assets that would otherwise have\ncontractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest but do not meet that condition\nonly as a result of a prepayment feature. This is subject to meeting other conditions, such as the nature of\nthe business model relevant to the financial asset. Otherwise, the financial assets would be measured at\nfair value through profit or loss. The Standard also clarifies in the Basis for Conclusion that, under AASB\n9, gains and losses arising on modifications of financial liabilities that do not result in derecognition should\nbe recognised in profit or loss.\n\n\n_Impact:_\n\n\nThe Directors anticipate that the adoption of AASB 2017-6 will have no impact on the recognition of\namounts in the Group’s financial statements, but there will be additional disclosures required.\n\n\n\nAASB 2017-7 _Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Long-term Interests_\n_in Associates and Joint Ventures_\n\nThis Standard amends AASB 128 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures to clarify that an entity\nis required to account for long term interests in an associate or joint venture, which in substance form\npart of the net investment in the associate or joint venture but to which the equity method is not applied,\nusing AASB 9 Financial Instruments before applying the loss allocation and impairment requirements in\nAASB 128.\n\n\n_Impact:_\n\n\nThe Directors anticipate that the adoption of AASB 2017-7 will have no impact on the recognition of\namounts in the Group’s financial statements, but there will be additional disclosures required.\n\nNot yet issued _Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2015-2017 Cycle_\nby the AASB The amendments clarify certain requirements in:\n\n\na) IFRS 3 Business Combinations and IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements – previously held interest in a\njoint operation\n\nb) IAS 12 Income Taxes – income tax consequences of payments on financial instruments\nclassified as equity\n\n\nc) IAS 23 Borrowing Costs – borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.\n\n\n\nAASB\nInterpretation 23,\nand relevant\namending\nstandards\n\n\n\n_Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments_\nThe Interpretation clarifies the application of the recognition and measurement criteria in AASB 112\nIncome Taxes when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments.
