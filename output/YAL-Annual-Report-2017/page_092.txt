(ii) Operating EBIT
The Executive Committee assesses the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of Operating EBIT. This measure excludes
the effects of non-recurring expenditure from the operating segments such as restructuring costs, business combination related expenses and
significant impairments of cash-generating units. Furthermore, the measure excludes the effects of fair value re-measurements and foreign
exchange gains/(losses) on interest-bearing liabilities. Interest income and expense are not allocated to the NSW and QLD segments, as this
type of activity is driven by the corporate function, which manages the cash position of the Group.
A reconciliation of Operating EBIT to profit/(loss) before income tax from continuing operations is provided as follows:
