ANNUAL REPORT 2016
China’s sustained commitment
to reduced domestic production
in the second half of the year,
provided an immediate impetus
for price improvements in prime
coking coal prices, benefitting
the majority of the coal sector
throughout the fourth quarter
reporting period.
Increased demand and price
improvements drove new market highs
for the settlement of industry quarterly
semi-soft coking coal and PCI coal
benchmark prices in October.
Annual gains were offset slightly by
the shifting preferences away from
coal, specifically driven by Europe and
the United States, as those markets
moved towards a reliance upon gas and
alternative energy sources.
Yancoal’s product sales split
(equity share) for the 2016 period was
11.6Mt (2015 10.2Mt) thermal coal and
7.7Mt (2015 7.6Mt) metallurgical coal.
Yancoal Australia Sales Pty Ltd (YAS)
continued to facilitate the sale of coal
blends, contracting with and paying
the supplying coal mines, whether
operated wholly or in joint venture by
a Yancoal subsidiary, an asset managed
by Yancoal Australia Ltd on behalf of
Yancoal International Holdings Co., Ltd,
or a third party mine.
The road ahead
Prime coking coal prices continue to
appreciate with the support of Indian
demand and China’s current commitment
to reduced domestic production.
Further positive improvements in
global metallurgical and thermal coal
prices will be tempered in comparison
to 2016’s rapid growth, mostly due to
the undetermined potential for further
China-based decisions regarding future
import requirements.
Coal demand in Asia is still expected to
be strong, with continued growth in coal
demand expected in the future.
Yancoal continues to maximise its
blending arrangements across the New
South Wales operations.
