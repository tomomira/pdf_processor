ANNUAL REPORT 2016
REMUNERATION REPORT – AUDITED
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to introduce the Yancoal Australia Ltd (the “Company”) and its controlled entities (the “Group”) 2016
Remuneration Report. Over 2016, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee continued to review the Company’s
remuneration framework to ensure remuneration arrangements were in line with sound corporate governance for an
Australian listed company and for a Company of its size. Key principles of the Committee’s focus over 2016 were to:
•	 Ensure the Company’s remuneration structures were equitable and aligned with the long term interests of the
Company and its stakeholders, and having regard to relevant Company policies;
•	 Provide market competitive remuneration and conditions which support the attraction and retention of skilled
and motivated employees;
•	 Structure short and long term incentives that are challenging and aligned to the creation of sustainable returns,
and the achievement of company strategy, objectives and performance; and
•	 Differentiate reward based on performance, in particular acknowledging the contribution of outstanding performers.
This report sets out remuneration information for the Company’s Key Management Personnel for the 12 months ended
31 December 2016.
Yours sincerely,
Xiyong Li
Chairman of the Board, Chair of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee

a member of one of the IBC’s constituted in 2016 due to the risk of an actual or perceived conflict of interest in respect of the particular matters to be addressed by the IBC
arising from his directorship at the time in various subsidiaries of Yanzhou. **Huaqiao Zhang appointed Lei Zhang as an alternate director to act on his behalf, solely for the
board meeting of the Company on 17 August 2016.
