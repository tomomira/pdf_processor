ANNUAL REPORT 2016
Note:
+ve = increase in reported Coal Resources, -ve = decrease in reported Coal Resources.
1.	The reported Coal Resources within the JORC Resource Reports used for public reporting are rounded (significant figure), whereas the Coal Resource
reconciliations are based on unrounded numbers. This adjustment is required to align the reconciliations with the rounded totals of the 2015 and 2016 JORC
Coal Resources and Reserves Reports.
