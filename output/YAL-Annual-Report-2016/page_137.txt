Royalty receivable
The fair value of the royalty receivable is the fair value of the right to receive a royalty of four percent of Free on Board Trimmed
Sales from the Middlemount Mine. The financial asset has a finite life being the life of the Middlemount Mine and will be measured
on a fair value basis.
The fair value is determined using the discounted future cash flows that are dependent on the following unobservable inputs:
forecast sales volumes, coal prices and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The forecast sales volumes are based on the internally
maintained budgets, five year business plan and life of mine models. The forecast coal prices and long term exchange rates are based
on external data consistent with the data used for impairment assessments (refer to Note C3). The risk-adjusted post-tax discount
rate used to determine the future cash flows is 10.5 percent.
The estimated fair value could increase significantly if the following unobservable inputs of sales volumes and coal prices were
higher and if the Australian dollar weakens against the US dollar. The estimated fair value would also increase if the risk-adjusted
discount rate was lower.
(iv) Fair values of other financial instruments
The carrying amount is approximate to the fair value for the following:
(i)	 Trade and other receivables;
(ii)	 Other financial assets;
(iii)	Trade and other payables;
(iv)	 Interest-bearing liabilities.
