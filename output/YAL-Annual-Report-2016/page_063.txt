3.6 Share Trading Policy and Insider Trading Policy
The Company’s Share Trading Policy prohibits dealing in Company securities or Yanzhou securities by Key Management Personnel
and other relevant employees, as well as their closely related parties, during specified blackout periods each year. Subject to compliance
with the Company’s Insider Trading Policy, employees are permitted to deal in Company securities or Yanzhou securities outside these
blackout periods, however additional approval requirements apply to Directors.
The Share Trading Policy precludes relevant employees from entering into any hedge or derivative transactions relating to unvested
options or share rights granted to them under incentive plans and securities that are subject to holding locks or restrictions from
dealing under such plans. There are also restrictions regarding margin lending arrangements, hedging and short-term trading of the
Company’s securities. A copy of the Share Trading Policy and the Insider Trading Policy are available in the Corporate Governance
section of the Company’s website.

the Company. See Sections 3.5.1, 3.5.2 and 3.5.3 for further detail. The Company’s earnings and delivery of shareholder wealth
for the past four years is outlined in the table below.
