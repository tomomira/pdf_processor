ANNUAL REPORT 2016
Sensitivity
The following table summarises the sensitivity of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities to a reasonable possible change in the US
dollar exchange rate. The Group’s exposure to other foreign exchange movements is not material. The Group has used the observed
range of actual historical rates for the preceding five year period, with a heavier weighting placed on recently observed market data,
in determining reasonably possible exchange movements to be used for the current year’s sensitivity analysis. Past movements are
not necessarily indicative of future movements. A 10 percent depreciation/appreciation of the Australian dollar against the US dollar
would have (decreased)/increased equity and profit or loss after tax by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other
variables remain constant.
