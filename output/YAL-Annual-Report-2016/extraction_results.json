Yancoal remains committed to proactively\nimproving the systems and processes employed across sites to\neducate, communicate and record employee safety initiatives.\nIn April 2016 Yancoal and the Austar1 operation received formal\nnotification from the Department of Industry, Resources and\nEnergy confirming it would not be instituting prosecution\nproceedings related to the investigation into the Austar\nunderground incident of 15 April 2014.\nIn August 2016, a small coal burst occurred in the main working\narea of the Austar underground mine. Following a thorough and\nimmediate review by Yancoal (in its capacity as the management\nservices provider to Austar mine) and the relevant New South\nWales Government departments, the Austar mine implemented\nadditional safety barriers and controls in the working area prior\nto the resumption of mining.\nUnder the direction of the Health, Safety, Environment\nand Community Committee, Yancoal continues to build the\nleadership, capabilities, systems and reporting procedures\nrequired to deliver on its objectives of achieving zero harm\nat its operations.\nFinancial performance\nThe loss after income tax for the year ended 31 December 2016\namounted to $227.1 million (31 December 2015: $291.2 million).\nSignificant global thermal coal market price improvements and\nthe establishing of 2016 industry-high quarterly benchmark\nprices for semi-soft coking and PCI coal during the second half,\ndrove sales volume increases and earnings improvements for the\nfourth quarter of the reporting period.\nYancoal responded to sustained low coal prices and existing\noperating cash flow constraints in the first half of the year via\na debt funding arrangement and transfer of control of the Austar,\nAshton and Donaldson operations to a newly established Yancoal\nsubsidiary, Watagan Mining Company Pty Ltd (“Watagan”),\nas announced 17 February 2016.\nCost reduction strategies continued to be supported at all\noperations, with the Moolarben Stage Two project delivering\ncritical development and construction goals on time and on\nbudget, including the commencement of development coal from\nthe new Moolarben underground and opening of the new open\ncut box cut.\nThroughout 2016, Yancoal continued to restructure its\noperations, maximise blending across the New South Wales\nmine sites (operated and managed), and proactively managed\nits existing take-or-pay arrangements.",

The subsidiaries of Watagan include\nthe three NSW underground coal mining operations of Ashton,\nAustar and Donaldson.\nOn and from financial close of the arrangement, effective 31\nMarch, Yancoal ceased to control Watagan and its subsidiaries,\nincluding the NSW underground assets of Austar, Ashton and\nDonaldson. Yancoal will provide mine management, marketing,\ninfrastructure and other corporate support services for the\nWatagan mines under 10-year contracts.\nAs part of the arrangement for the subscription and issue of the\nsecured debt bonds, and as announced 1 April 2016, BOCI was\nto subscribe for the remaining US$175 million of BOCI’s total\nproposed subscription of US$375 million by 30 September 2016.\nHowever, all parties agreed to extend BOCI’s subscription date\nin respect of that US$175 million amount to 31 March 2017.\nThe Ashton, Austar and Donaldson mines are managed\nby Yancoal Mining Services Pty Ltd (“YMS”), a fully-owned\nYancoal subsidiary and employing entity for all eastern\nregion underground operations staff, established during\nthe reporting period.\nOn 2 March 2016, Yancoal announced the Donaldson operation\nwas to move to ‘care and maintenance’ during the first half\nof the year, following the cessation of mining activities and\nthe commencement of new feasibility studies. Mining ceased\nat Donaldson’s Abel underground mine on 6 June 2016.\nMining operations\n(all figures reported on a 100 percent basis)\nIn NSW, Yancoal continued to operate the Moolarben and\nStratford Duralie open cut mines throughout the reporting\nperiod, with control of the underground mines of Austar, Ashton\nand Donaldson transferring to Watagan from 31 March 2016.\nYancoal continued to manage the assets on behalf of Watagan\nthroughout the reporting period.\nIn Queensland, Yancoal operated the Yarrabee open cut\noperation and maintained its near 50 percent equity interest\nin Middlemount Coal Pty Ltd (“Middlemount”) throughout\nthe reporting period.\nFleet and mine plan efficiencies at Yancoal’s Moolarben and\nYarrabee open cut mines drove strong production throughout\nthe reporting period, with the Group achieving total Run of Mine\n(“ROM”) coal production of 26.2 million tonnes (“Mt”) (21.2Mt\nequity share) for the year (31 December 2015: 20.8Mt equity\nshare) and saleable coal production of 19.8Mt (16.0Mt equity\nshare) for the year (31 December 2015: 15.2Mt equity share).\n2016’s total production result was above the previously\npublished operational guidance of 13.0Mt saleable coal (equity\nshare), as Yancoal responded to increased market demand and\nglobal coal market price improvements during the second half\nof the year.\nTotal coal sales (equity share) were 19.3Mt for the year\n(31 December 2015: 17.8Mt).\nYancoal’s sales split (equity share) for the period was 11.6Mt\n(2015 10.2Mt) thermal and 7.7Mt (2015 7.6Mt) metallurgical coal.\nYancoal continued to manage the Cameby Downs and\nPremier coal mining operations in Queensland and Western\nAustralia respectively, on behalf of its majority shareholder\nYanzhou Coal Mining Company Limited (“Yanzhou”)\nthroughout the reporting period.\nNew South Wales\nNSW operations achieved total ROM coal production\nof 17.3Mt (2015 16.5Mt) (Yancoal-controlled2 13.4Mt,\nWatagan-controlled2 3.9Mt) and saleable coal production\nof 12.6Mt (2015 11.8Mt) (Yancoal-controlled 10.2Mt,\nWatagan-controlled 2.4Mt) for the period.\nConsistently strong production gains at Moolarben’s open\ncut operation as a result of established fleet and mine plan\nefficiencies, helped offset a slow-down in production at the\nStratford Duralie open cut.",

REMUNERATION PRINCIPLES AND FRAMEWORK\nThe Company’s governing principles for remuneration are:\n•\t To ensure remuneration is equitable, aligned with the long term\ninterests of the Company and its shareholders and complies\nwith relevant Company policies, including the Diversity Policy;\n•\t To provide market competitive remuneration and conditions to\nattract and retain skilled and motivated employees;\n•\t To structure short and long term incentives that are challenging\nto create sustainable returns and to support the achievement of\nthe Company’s strategies and objectives; and\n•\t To reward based on performance, in particular acknowledging\nthe contribution of outstanding performers.\n2.1 Remuneration governance framework\nConsistent with its Board Charter, the Board oversees the\nappointment, remuneration and performance of all Key\nManagement Personnel (“KMP”) other than Directors and,\nother members of the Executive Committee. On these issues,\nthe Board receives recommendations from the Nomination\nand Remuneration Committee.\nThe Nomination and Remuneration Committee’s objective\nis to assist the Board by making recommendations in relation to:\n•\t Board composition and succession planning for the Board;\n•\t Remuneration levels and structure for KMP, and other members\nof the Executive Committee as appointed from time to time;\n•\t The public reporting of remuneration for KMP, and other\nmembers of the Executive Committee;\n•\t The performance assessment of the Executive Committee;\n•\t Designing Company remuneration policy and regulations\nwith regard to corporate governance; and\n•\t Diversity.\nIt had been intended to review the Long Term Incentive Plan\n(“LTIP”) during 2016, however due to more pressing priorities\nthe review has been postponed until 2017. As Yancoal stabilises\nand develops a sustainable business model to be a major and\ncompetitive force in the mining sector in Australia it will be\nimportant to consider an appropriate employee long term\nincentive scheme for the company. It is well recognised that long\nterm incentive schemes for employees of the company can drive\nlong term positive value for the Shareholders. Having a LTIP\nfor employees tends to lead to better overall performance by the\ncompany which in turn incentivises all employees of the company.\nWe intend to explore and develop an appropriate LTIP proposal\nfor Senior Yancoal Employees for consideration of the Board.\nThis will be proposed via the Nomination and Remuneration\nCommittee in 2017.\nDirectors’ Report",

EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION\nThe Executive remuneration structure below is an appropriate\nreflection of Yanzhou’s majority shareholding in the Company.\n3.1 Objective\nRemuneration frameworks for Executives are structured\nto be market competitive and to reflect the reward strategy\nof the organisation. Through these frameworks the Company\nseeks to align remuneration for Executives with:\nShareholders' interests by:\n•\t Making economic performance a core component of the overall\nremuneration plan design;\n•\t Focusing on the key value drivers of the business including\nemployee safety, operational performance and cost control; and\n•\t Attracting and retaining high calibre executives.\n3.3 Remuneration mix\nThe relative proportion of remuneration entitlement for Executives that is fixed (excluding benefits) and that which is linked\nto individual or Company performance or both (referred to as ‘at risk’) is as follows:\nBoyun Xu is an Executive Director of Yancoal, however his executive role relates to Yancoal International (Holding) Co., Ltd (“YIH”). Mr Xu’s remuneration is paid for by YIH\nand as such he is not considered a senior executive of Yancoal.\nA Calculations for fixed remuneration entitlement exclude the value of benefits, see table 3 and table 11;\nB The short term variable remuneration entitlement is determined pursuant to the Short Term Incentive Plan (outlined in section 3.5.1);\nC The Special Incentive Scheme is outlined in section 3.5.2;\nD The Long Term Incentive Plan is outlined in section 3.5.3.\nExecutive’s interests by:\n•\t Rewarding capability and experience;\n•\t Reflecting competitive reward for contribution to growth\nin company performance;\n•\t Providing a clear structure for earning rewards; and\n•\t Providing recognition for contribution.\nDetails of remuneration for all Executives are set out in Table 11\n(See Section 6: Remuneration tables).\n3.2 Structure\nAll remuneration frameworks for Executives are structured\nas a combination of fixed and variable remuneration, as follows:\nTABLE 2: Executive remuneration structure\nFixed remuneration\n•\t Fixed Annual Remuneration (“FAR”), including cash salary, superannuation, and may include car\nallowance; and\n•\t Other benefits (see Section 3.4).\nVariable remuneration\n(‘at risk’)\n•\t Short-term Incentive (see Section 3.5.1)\n•\t Special Incentive Scheme (see Section 3.5.2), and\n•\t Long-term Incentive (see Section 3.5.3).\nTABLE 3: Proportion of Executives’ remuneration entitlement at risk\nName\nFixed Remuneration\n(Excl.

      "text_content": "60\nANNUAL REPORT 2016\n3.4 Fixed Remuneration\nFixed remuneration comprises cash salary, superannuation\nand other benefits. In recognition of the Company’s financial\nperformance, no fixed remuneration increases were awarded in\n2016. Executives receive a salary package, in the form of a FAR\npackage, which incorporates cash salary, superannuation benefits\nand may include a provision for a car allowance, together with\ncertain other benefits.\nSenior Executives’ level of fixed remuneration is set to provide a\nbase level of remuneration which is appropriate to the position\nand competitive with companies in a similar industry. Each year\nExecutives’ FAR is reviewed by reference to the Coal Mining\nIndustry Remuneration Report produced by McDonald &\nCompany (Australasia) Pty Ltd (“McDonald Report”). Using the\nMcDonald Report, the Company’s Remuneration Policy targets\nFAR at the 75th percentile of the relevant industry benchmark\nwhich reflects market practice in the coal industry in Australia.\nHaving regard to the specific characteristics of the role, each\nemployment position is then assigned a Job Salary Rate (“JSR”),\nand Executives are paid at between 80 percent and 120 percent\nof the JSR.\nSenior Executives’ superannuation benefits are paid to their\nnominated superannuation fund in accordance with relevant\nstate and industry legislation. No Executives are entitled to a\nguaranteed increase in FAR. Senior Executives may receive\ncertain benefits as part of their fixed remuneration including car\nparking, travel allowances and relocation allowances. Executives\nhave some scope to determine the combination of cash (including\ncar allowance) and certain non-monetary benefits by which their\nFAR is delivered, provided that it does not create undue cost for\nthe Company.\n3.5 Variable remuneration\nVariable remuneration is delivered through participation in the\nSTI Plan (as outlined in section 3.5.1) and a Special Incentive\nScheme (as outlined in section 3.5.2). Certain Executives are also\neligible to participate in a LTI Plan (as outlined in section 3.5.3).\n3.5.1 Short Term Incentive Plan\nEligibility\nThe STI Plan applies to Executives as well as to the broader\nmanagement and employees of the Company.\nObjective\nThe objective of the STI Plan is to reward Executives and\nemployees for the achievements of the Company, Business Unit\nand individual goals that are aligned to the Company’s financial,\noperational and strategic priorities.\nStructure\nFor 2016 the STI Plan comprised three key components:\n1.\t STI opportunity—this is expressed as a percentage of the\nExecutive’s FAR. The STI opportunity is reviewed annually.\nA benchmarking exercise is completed against comparable\npeers in listed companies, and no changes were proposed for\n2016. The CEO has an agreed STI opportunity of between a\nminimum of 75 percent and a maximum of 126 percent of FAR\nfor 2016.  The Board believes this level of STI opportunity is\nreasonable and competitive for the current environment.\n2.\t STI Scorecard—this consists of a number of Key Performance\nIndicators (“KPIs”). For the Executives named in this report,\nall KPIs are measured at the Company level. The KPIs fall\ninto the following categories TRIFR (Total Recordable Injury\nFrequency Rate) (20 percent weighting), Environment (10\npercent weighting), FOR (Free On Rail) Cash Costs (35 percent\nweighting), Profitability (20 percent weighting) and Specific\nBusiness Unit Measures (15 percent).) Details of how the\nSTI Scorecard is evaluated are set out below. STI scorecard\nperformance is assessed by the Chairman of the Executive\nCommittee and the Chief Executive Officer, reviewed by the\nNomination and Remuneration Committee, and approved by\nthe Board.\n3.\t Individual Performance—this is measured by Key\nResult Areas (“KRA”). These KRAs are aligned to the\nExecutive’s role and include areas such as special projects,\nachievement of operating and capital expenditure budgets,\nand achievement of growth/continuous improvement\ninitiatives. Based on performance against the KRAs, the\nExecutive receives a performance rating at the end of the year\non a scale from Exceptional to Below Standard. In the case of\nthe Chief Executive Officer, individual performance is assessed\nby the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, to be\nendorsed by the Board. For all other Executives, performance\nis assessed by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chair of the\nExecutive Committee.\nDirectors’ Report",

The structure and membership of the Nomination\nand Remuneration Committee is described further under\nPrinciples two and eight.\nThe Board recognises that people are its most important\nasset and is committed to the maintenance and promotion of\nworkplace diversity. Whilst traditionally, experience as a senior\nexecutive or director of a large organisation with international\noperations is a prerequisite for candidature, in accordance with\nthe Diversity Policy, the Board also seeks skills and experience\nin the following areas:\n•\t Marketing and sales;\n•\t Policy and regulatory development and reform;\n•\t Health, safety and environment and social responsibility; and\n•\t Human resources.\nIn identifying candidates, the Nomination and Remuneration\nCommittee will consider and select nominees by reference to a\nnumber of selection criteria including the skills, expertise and\nbackground that add to and complement the range of skills,\nexpertise and background of the existing directors, the capability\nof the candidate to devote the necessary time and commitment\nto the role, potential conflicts of interest and independence,\nand the extent to which the candidate would fill a present need\non the Board. Where appropriate, the appropriate checks are\nundertaken prior to a director being appointed. The mix of skills\ncurrently held by the Board is set out under Principle 2.\nThe role, rights and responsibilities and membership\nrequirements of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee,\ntogether with the selection criteria for candidates for the Board,\nare set out in the Nomination and Remuneration Committee\nCharter which can be found within the Corporate Governance\nsection of the Company’s website.\nShareholder approval is required for the appointment of\ndirectors. However, directors may appoint other directors to fill\na casual vacancy where the number of directors falls below the\nconstitutional minimum number of directors and in order to\ncomply with any applicable laws, regulations or the ASX Listing\nRules. If a director is appointed to fill a casual vacancy in these\ncircumstances, the approval of members must be sought at the\nnext general meeting.\nNo director may hold office without re-election beyond the third\nannual general meeting (AGM) following the meeting at which\nthe director was last elected or re-elected. The Company provides\nall material information in its possession in relation to directors\nstanding for election or re-election in the Notice of Meeting\nprovided to shareholders prior to the AGM.\nTo the extent that the ASX Listing Rules require an election of\ndirectors to be held and no director would otherwise be required\nunder the Company’s Constitution to submit for election or\nre-election at an AGM, the director who has been the longest in\noffice since their last election or appointment must retire at the\nAGM. As between directors who were last elected or appointed\non the same day, where it is not agreed between the relevant\ndirectors, the director to retire must be decided by lot.\nThe process for appointment, retirement and re-election of\ndirectors is set out in the Company’s Constitution which can\nbe found within the Corporate Governance section of the\nCompany’s website.\nDiversity\nThe Company recognises that people are its most important\nasset and is committed to the maintenance and promotion\nof workplace diversity. The Company has adopted a Diversity\nPolicy, approved by the Board, to actively facilitate a more diverse\nand representative management and leadership structure. The\nDiversity Policy is available in the Corporate Governance section\nof the Company’s website.\nAnnually, the Board establishes measurable objectives with\nthe assistance of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee\nwith a view to progressing towards a balanced representation\nof women at a Board and senior management level. Performance\nagainst these measurable objectives are reviewed annually by the\nNomination and Remuneration Committee as part of its annual\nreview of the effectiveness of the Diversity Policy.",

These sessions were aimed at promoting a bullying and harassment\nfree environment, encouraging all employees to speak up about incidents and to ensure that\nthe Company’s culture is aligned to Yancoal values and behaviours.\nEmployees across the organisation have access to the Company’s Code of Conduct\nvia the Company intranet and are reminded of this via inductions, crew talks and as relevant\nissues arise.\n2.\t To target a diverse group\nof candidates with recruitment\nand selection procedures that are\nmerit-based and non-discriminatory;\nAcross the Yancoal group, merit-based, non-discriminatory practices are adhered to in the\nrecruitment of new employees.\n3.\t To ensure our managers\nare adept recruiters, retainers and\nmotivators of our diverse workplace.\nOur Human Resources team is actively involved with management in the process of recruiting\nnew employees, including being involved in interviews of potential employers, coaching and\nmentoring on targeted selection techniques and merit-based selection, as well as ensuring\ngeneral diversity awareness with regards to candidates.\nThe “Yancoal Way” continues to be rolled out across the Group. The message of continuous\nimprovement and ‘blue bus’ thinking is promoted during recruitment, induction and performance\nreviews to promote a culture that encourages engagement, diversity and continuous learning.\nProportion of women in the company\nGender has been identified as a key area of focus for\nthe Company. On an annual basis, the Nomination and\nRemuneration Committee reviews the proportion of women\nemployed by the Company and submits a report to the Board\noutlining its findings. Details regarding the proportion of men\nand women throughout the organisation are set out below.\nDuring 2016, the proportion of women who were directly\nemployed by the Company as a whole was 10 percent:\n171 Full-time, five Part-time and 10 Casual, a decrease\nof 1.0 percent from 2015. The proportion of women in senior\nmanagement roles (being roles which directly report to the\nCEO or CEC) within the Company during 2016 was eight\npercent: Women held one of 12 senior management roles\nwithin the Company.\nThere are no women on the Company’s Board.\nPerformance of the Board, its committees\nand individual directors\nThe Nomination and Remuneration Committee oversees an\nannual evaluation process for the Board, its committees and each\ndirector based on the Board Performance Evaluation Protocol\n(Protocol) adopted and approved by the Board in 2012.\nThe Board\nPeriodically, a review of the structure and operation of the Board,\nthe skills and characteristics required by the Board to maximise\nits effectiveness and whether the mix of skills, experience\nand expertise and the Board’s practices and procedures are\nappropriate for the present and future needs of the Company\nis conducted. This evaluation of performance of the Board may\nbe conducted with the assistance of an external facilitator.\nAs set out in the Board Charter, the review of the Board involves\ndirectors providing written feedback on the Board’s performance\nto the Chairman or to an external facilitator, which in turn is\ndiscussed by the Board, with consideration of whether any\nsteps for improvement are required.\nIt is expected that externally facilitated reviews will occur\napproximately every three years. The independent external\nfacilitator will seek input from each of the Directors and certain\nmembers of senior management in relation to the performance\nof the Board against a set of agreed criteria.\nOnce an externally facilitated review occurs, the progress\nagainst any recommendations from the most recent externally\nfacilitated review, together with any new issues, will be\nconsidered internally. Feedback from each director against a\nset of agreed criteria will be collected by the Chairman or the\nexternal facilitator. The CEC and CEO will also provide feedback\nfrom senior executives in connection with any issues that may\nbe relevant in the context of the Board performance review.",

However, the Board considers\nthat its composition appropriately represents the interests of its\nshareholders including its major shareholder, Yanzhou, and that\nthe Board has put in place appropriate policies and procedures\nto guide the Board and senior executives in circumstances where\nconflicts of interest may arise in its dealings with Yanzhou,\nincluding establishing the Independent Board Committee\nreferred to above.\nTo help ensure that any conflicts of interests are identified,\nthe Company has put in place a standing agenda item at all\nmeetings of the Board and its committees to provide the\ndirectors with the opportunity of declaring any conflicts\nof interests in the subject matter of the proposed resolutions\nmade within the meeting.\nTo assist the Board in making independent judgements,\nthe Board Charter sets out the procedure by which the Board\ncollectively, and each individual director, can seek independent\nprofessional advice, at the Company’s expense.\nEach independent director must regularly provide the Board with\nall information relevant to their continued compliance with the\nindependence standard. The independence of directors will be\nreviewed by the Board on a regular basis with assistance from the\nNomination and Remuneration Committee. The Nomination and\nRemuneration Committee will also assist the Board with regular\nevaluation of the performance of the Board, Board committees\nand individual directors.\nIndependence standard\nIn assessing the independence of its directors, the Board has\nregard to the factors relevant to assessing the independence\nof a director that are set out in Box 2.3 of the ASX\nRecommendations (3rd edition). The criteria considered\nin assessing the independence of Non-Executive Directors\nare also set out in the Board Charter.\nA director is considered independent if the director:\n•\t Is not, and has not within the last three years been,\nemployed in an executive capacity by the Company\nor any of its child entities;\n•\t Is not, nor has within the last three years been, a partner,\ndirector or senior employee of a provider of material\nprofessional services to the Company or any of its child entities;\n•\t Is not, nor has within the last three years been, in a material\nbusiness relationship with the Company or any of its child\nentities, or an officer of, or otherwise associated with, someone\nwith such a relationship;\n•\t Is not a substantial Shareholder of the Company or an officer\nof, or otherwise associated with, a substantial Shareholder\nof the Company;\n•\t Does not have a material contractual relationship with the\nCompany or any of its child entities other than as a director;\n•\t Does not have close family ties with any person who falls\nwithin any of the categories described above;\n•\t Has not been a director of the Company for such a period that\nhis or her independence may have been compromised; and\n•\t Is free from any other interest, position, association or\nrelationship that might interfere, or might reasonably be\nseen to interfere, with the director’s capacity to bring an\nindependent judgement to bear on issues before the Board\nand to act in the best interests of the Company and its\nshareholders generally.\nThe Company’s Constitution provides that the Company’s\nshareholders holding a majority of the issued shares of the\nCompany (which confer the right to vote) may nominate\na director to the office of Chairman and may elect one\nor more directors to the office of Vice Chair.",

      "text_content": "82\nANNUAL REPORT 2016\nCorporate Governance Statement\nOperating risks\nThe Company’s operations are subject to operating risks that\ncould result in decreased coal production which could reduce\ntheir respective revenues. Operational difficulties may impact\nthe amount of coal produced, delay coal deliveries or increase\nthe cost of mining for a varying length of time. These operating\nrisks include (but are not limited to) industrial, mine collapses,\ncave-ins or other failures relating to mine infrastructure,\nincluding tailings dams, interruptions due to inclement or\nhazardous weather conditions, power interruption, critical\nequipment failure (in particular any protracted breakdown or\nissues with any of the Company’s CHPP or a major excavator),\nfires, and explosions from methane gas or coal dust, accidental\nmine water discharges, flooding and variations in or unusual\nor unexpected geological or geotechnical mining conditions\n(particularly in the Company’s underground operations). Such\nrisks could result in damage to applicable mines, personal injury,\nenvironmental damage, delays in coal production, decreased\ncoal production, loss of revenue, monetary losses and possible\nlegal liability. Although the Company’s insurance policies provide\ncoverage for some of these risks, the amount and scope of\ninsurance cover is limited by market and economic factors\nand there can be no assurance that these risks would be fully\ncovered by insurances maintained by the Company.\nInjury or accident risks\nIf any injuries or accidents occur in a mine, this could have\nadverse financial implications including legal claims for personal\ninjury, wrongful death, amendments to approvals, potential\nproduction delays or stoppages, any of which may have a material\nadverse effect on the financial performance and/or financial\nposition of the Company.\nFunding risks\nThe amount of future funding required by the Company will\ndepend on a number of factors, including the performance of\nthe Company’s business at that time. The Company’s business\noperations and cash flow are highly sensitive to any fluctuation in\nthe US$ coal price, coal production from its operations, demand\nfor its coal product and US$ movement in foreign exchange rates,\nparticularly movements in the A$:US$ exchange rate.\nIn developing its business plan and operating budget, the\nCompany has made certain assumptions regarding coal prices,\nthe A$:US$ exchange rate, future production levels and other\nfactors which determine the Company’s financial performance.\nIf a funding shortfall materialises, the Company may need to raise\nsubstantial additional debt or equity. The Company’s capacity to\nsecure the requisite level of funding will depend on the amount\nof funding required, the performance and future prospects of its\nbusiness and a number of other factors, including US$ coal prices,\ninterest rates, economic conditions, debt market conditions,\nequity market conditions, and future levels of Yanzhou support.\nTo the extent that the Company is not able to secure additional\nfinancing (whether debt or equity) on acceptable terms from third\nparties, the Company will continue to rely on financial support\nfrom Yanzhou.\nAdverse foreign exchange rate movements\nForeign exchange risk is the risk of the Company sustaining\nloss through adverse movements in exchange rates. Such losses\ncan impact the Company’s financial position and performance\nand the level of additional funding required to support the\nCompany’s businesses.\nThe liabilities, earnings and cash flows of the Company\nare influenced by movements in exchange rates, especially\nmovements in the A$:US$ exchange rate.\nForeign currency exposure arises particularly in relation to coal\nsupply contracts, which generally are priced and payable in US$,\nprocurement of imported plant and equipment, which can be\npriced in US$ or other foreign currencies, and debt denominated\nin currencies other than A$.\nThe impact of exchange rate movements will vary depending\non factors such as the nature, magnitude and duration of the\nmovements, the extent to which currency risk is hedged under\nforward exchange contracts and the terms of these contracts.\nThe Company has put in place accounting hedges, pursuant\nto Australian Accounting Standard 139, where future US$\ndenominated loan repayments are designated as “natural cash\nflow hedges” of future US$ denominated coal sales revenues in\nthe periods immediately prior to each committed debt repayment.",

      "text_content": "83\nANNUAL REPORT 2016\nCoal prices and coal demand risks\nThe Company generates revenue from the sale of coal.\nIn developing its business plan and operating budget, the\nCompany makes certain assumptions regarding coal prices\nand demand for coal. The prices which the Company will receive\nfor its coal depend on numerous market factors beyond its control\nand, accordingly, some underlying coal price assumptions relied\non by the Company may materially change and actual coal prices\nand demand may differ materially from those expected.\nThe prices for coal are determined predominantly by world\nmarkets, which are affected by numerous factors, including the\noutcome of future sale contract negotiations, general economic\nactivity, industrial production levels, changes in foreign exchange\nrates, changes in energy demand and demand for steel, changes\nin the supply of seaborne coal, technological changes, changes\nin production levels and events interfering with supply, changes\nin international freight rates or other transportation\ninfrastructure and costs, the costs of other commodities and\nsubstitutes for coal, market changes in coal quality requirements,\ngovernment regulations which restrict use of coal, and tax\nimpositions on the resources industry, all of which are outside\nthe control of the Company and may have a material adverse\nimpact on coal prices and demand.\nCoal production risks\nImprovement in the Company’s financial performance\nis dependent on the Company being able to sustain or increase\ncoal production and decrease operating costs on a per tonne\nbasis. The Company’s success or failure in improving productivity\nwill become particularly important to the Company’s financial\nperformance if the coal price remains at current levels\nor falls further.\nThe Company’s coal production can be impacted by a number\nof factors, including unforeseen geological or geotechnical\nissues (particularly in the Company’s underground operations),\nabnormal wet weather conditions (particularly in Queensland),\nunforeseen delays or complexities in installing and operating\nmining longwall systems, protracted breakdown of coal handling\ninfrastructure and other mining equipment and rail and port\nbreakdowns and outages. Regulatory factors and the occurrence\nof other operating risks can also limit production.\nRegulatory approvals risks\nThe ability of the Company to meet its long term production\ntarget profile depends on (amongst other things) the Company\nbeing able to obtain on a timely basis, and maintain, all\nnecessary regulatory approvals (including any approvals\narising under applicable mining laws, environmental\nregulations and other laws) for its current operations and\nexpansion and growth projects, including obtaining planning\napprovals, land access, land owner consents and addressing\nany native title issues, impacts on the environment and\nobjections from local communities.\nThere is no assurance or guarantee that the Company will\nbe in a position to secure any or all of the required consents,\napprovals and rights necessary to maintain its current production\nprofile from its existing operations or to develop its growth\nprojects in a manner which will result in profitable mining\noperations and the achievement of its long term production\ntargets. If these approvals (or other approvals required for the\nplanned production increases) are not obtained, or if conditional\nor limited approvals are obtained, the economic viability of the\nrelevant projects may be adversely affected, which may in turn\nresult in the value of the relevant assets being impaired.\nThe Company continues to engage openly and transparently\nwith all State and federal Government and approval bodies,\nwhile operating to the highest safety, environmental and\nlegislative standards to work towards facilitating all approvals\nas required.\nEstimates of Resources and Reserves and geology\nThe volume and quality of the coal that the Company recovers\nmay be less than the Resource and Reserve estimates reported to\ndate. Resource and Reserve estimates are expressions of judgment\nbased on knowledge, experience and industry practice. There are\nrisks associated with such estimates, including that coal mined\nmay be of a different quality or grade, tonnage or strip ratio from\nthose in the estimates and the ability to economically extract\nand process the coal may not eventuate. Resource and Reserve\nestimates are necessarily imprecise and depend to some extent\non interpretations and geological assumptions, coal prices, cost\nassumptions, and statistical inferences which may ultimately\nprove to have been unreliable.",

      "text_content": "84\nANNUAL REPORT 2016\nResource and Reserve estimates are regularly revised based\non actual production experience or new information and could\ntherefore be expected to change. Furthermore, should the\nCompany encounter mineralisation or formations different\nfrom those predicted by past drilling, sampling and similar\nexaminations, Resource and Reserve estimates may have to be\nadjusted and mining plans, coal processing and infrastructure\nmay have to be altered in a way that might adversely affect their\noperations. If it is determined that mining of certain Reserves\nare uneconomic, this may lead to a reduction in the Company’s\naggregate Reserve estimates.\nIf the Company’s actual Resource and Reserve estimates are less\nthan current estimates, the Company’s prospects, value, business,\nresults of operations and financial condition may be materially\nadversely affected.\nTake-or-pay liabilities\nPort and rail (above rail and below rail) capacity is generally\ncontracted via long-term take-or-pay contracts. The Company will\ngenerally be required to pay for its contracted rail or port tonnage\nirrespective of whether it is utilised. Unused port or rail capacity\ncan arise as a result of circumstances including insufficient\nproduction from a given mine, a mismatch between port and rail\ncapacity for a mine, or an inability to transfer the used capacity\ndue to contractual limitations such as required consent of the\nprovider of the port or rail services, or because the coal must\nemanate from specified source mines or be loaded onto trains\nat specified load points.\nMine closure\nClosure of any of the mines or other operations of the Company\nbefore the end of their mine life (e.g. due to environmental and\n/or health and safety issues), could trigger significant employee\nredundancy costs, closure and rehabilitation expense and other\ncosts or loss of revenues. Many of these costs will also be incurred\nwhere mines are closed at the end of their planned mine life or\nplaced on care and maintenance. A move to care and maintenance\nhas the potential to trigger significant employee redundancy\ncosts and a subsequent loss of revenues, as a minimal employee\npresence is required for ongoing management and rehabilitation\nof the mine.\nIf one or more of the relevant sites are closed earlier than\nanticipated, the Company will be required to fund the closure\ncosts on an expedited basis and potentially lose revenues, which\ncould have an adverse financial effect. In addition, there is a risk\nthat claims may be made arising from environmental remediation\nupon closure of one or more of their sites.\nCoal supply agreements\nThe Company’s coal supply agreements typically require the\ndelivery of a fixed or minimum quantity of coal at a location, at\na time and over a period stipulated in the agreement. To the extent\nthat any contracted volumes cannot be delivered as agreed, the\nCompany may be liable to pay substantial compensation for the\nresulting losses, costs and charges (including demurrage) incurred\nby the buyer.\nAs customer contracts expire, the Company’s financial\nperformance may be adversely affected if it is unable to renew\nthose contracts or enter into replacement contracts on no less\nfavourable terms.\nIt is possible that the coal quality specifications required by\ncustomers and the market more broadly may evolve over time\nto meet import restrictions and other regulatory requirements,\ntechnology advancements and other factors. If the Company is\nunable to supply coal that meets those specifications, its financial\nperformance may be adversely affected.\nJoint ventures and reliance on third parties\nThe Company holds a number of joint venture interests,\nincluding interests in the Middlemount and Moolarben mines,\nPWCS, NCIG and WICET, with other parties. Decision making,\nmanagement, marketing and other key aspects of each joint\nventure are regulated by agreements between the relevant\njoint venture participants.\nThe Company cannot control the actions of third party joint\nventure participants, and therefore cannot guarantee that joint\nventures will be operated or managed in accordance with the\npreferred direction or strategy of the Company. There is a risk\nthat the veto rights of, or consents required from, the joint venture\npartners will prevent the business and assets of a joint venture\nfrom being developed, operated and managed in accordance\nwith that preferred direction or strategy.\nCorporate Governance Statement",

      "text_content": "85\nANNUAL REPORT 2016\nThe Company also use contractors and other third parties\nfor exploration, mining and other services generally, and\nis reliant on a number of third parties for the success of its\ncurrent operations and for the development of its growth\nprojects. While this is normal for the mining and exploration\nindustry, problems caused by third parties may arise which\nmay have an impact on the performance and operations\nof the Company. Any failure by counterparties to perform\ntheir obligations may have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany and there can be no assurance that the Company\nwill be successful in attempting to enforce its contractual\nrights through legal action.\nTitle risks\nExploring or mining for coal is generally illegal without a\ntenement granted by the State Governments. The grant and\nrenewal of tenements is subject to a regulatory regime and each\ntenement is subject to certain conditions. There is no certainty\nthat an application for grant or renewal of a tenement will\nbe granted at all or on satisfactory terms or within expected\ntimeframes. Further, the conditions attached to tenements may\nchange. The permitting rules are complex and may change over\ntime, making the title holder’s responsibility to comply with\nthe applicable requirements more onerous, more costly or even\nimpossible, thereby precluding or impairing continuing or future\nmining operations. There is a risk that the Company may lose title\nto any of its granted titles if it is unable to comply with conditions\nor if the land subject to the title is required for public purposes.\nThere is also a risk that a tenement may not be granted from any\napplications for renewals of tenements or for new tenements.\nOverlapping tenement risks\nSome of the Company’s mines and associated tenements adjoin\nor are overlapped by petroleum tenements and adjoin other\nexploration interests held by third parties. Overlapping tenements\ncould potentially prevent, delay or increase the cost of the future\ndevelopment of the Company’s projects because the Company and\nthe relevant petroleum exploration licence or other exploration\nlicence holders could potentially seek to undertake their\nrespective activities on the overlapping area or the same resource\nseams and in some cases the overlapping petroleum tenure\nholder’s consent may be required.\nEnforcement and counterparty insolvency risks\nThe Company has entered into contracts which are important\nto the future of its businesses including (but not limited to) for\nthe provision of coal handling services, long term sales contracts,\ndebt facilities, long term leases, contract mining and the provision\nof certain guarantees, indemnities and sureties.\nAny failure by counterparties to perform those contracts may\nhave a material adverse effect on the Company and there can\nbe no assurance that it would be successful in enforcing any\nof its contractual rights through legal action.\nIn addition, any insolvency of a counterparty to any of these\ncontracts may have a material adverse effect on the Company\nand there can be no assurance that it would be successful in\nenforcing any of its contractual rights through legal action or\nrecovering all monies owned by that counterparty (including\nunder any claim for damages).\nChanges in government policy, regulation or legislation\nThe resources industry is subject to extensive legislation,\nregulations and supervision by a number of federal and state\nregulatory organisations.\nAny future legislation and regulatory change may affect the\nresources industry and may adversely affect the Company’s\nfinancial performance and position, such as future laws that\nmay limit the emission of greenhouse gases or the use of coal\nin power generation.\nLitigation\nLike all companies in the resources sector, the Company is\nexposed to the risks of litigation (either as the complainant or\nas the defendant), which may have a material adverse effect on\nthe financial position of the relevant entity. The Company could\nbecome exposed to claims or litigation by persons alleging they\nare owed fees for services, employees, regulators, competitors\nor other third parties.\nExploration and development risks\nThere are several risks relating to coal mining exploration and\ndevelopment which are common to the industry and which,\nif realised, have the capacity to affect operations, production,\ncash flow and financial performance of the Company.",

If the Company is unsuccessful in these\nefforts or otherwise breaches these environmental requirements,\nit may incur fines or penalties, be required to curtail or cease\noperations and/or be subject to increased compliance costs or\ncosts for rehabilitation or rectification works, which have not been\npreviously planned at one or more of its sites.\nEnvironmental legislation may change in a manner that may\nrequire compliance with additional standards, and a heightened\ndegree of responsibility for companies and their directors\nand employees.

In general, the Company\nhas secured up to US$950 million in new debt funding via the\nissue of nine-year secured debt bonds by a newly established\nsubsidiary of the Company, Watagan Mining Company Pty Ltd\n(“Watagan”), to Industrial Bank Co., Ltd, BOCI Asia Financial\nProducts Limited and United NSW Energy (“UNE”).\nIn accordance with the terms of the Watagan Agreement, the\nCompany’s interests in the New South Wales mining assets of\nAshton, Austar and Donaldson have been transferred to Watagan,\na majority of directors of which are nominated by UNE. As a\nconsequence, the Company ceased to control Watagan and its\nsubsidiaries from an accounting perspective, and the assets,\nliabilities and results of Watagan and its subsidiaries will not\nbe incorporated into the Company’s consolidated financial\nstatements from the Completion date.\nAt the end of the term of the Bond Subscription Agreement,\nwhich is scheduled for in 2025, (or earlier if control over Watagan\nis determined to pass back to the Company), the Company would\nreconsolidate Watagan’s results and financial position for the\npoint that control is regained, and this re-acquisition would be\ntreated as a business combination. Additionally, the Bondholders\nhave a put option that allows them to put the issued debt bonds to\nYankuang at approximately years three, five, seven and nine of the\nbond term, or on an event of default after three years. Exercise of\nthis put option would also result in the Company regaining control\nof Watagan.\nAs of 31 December 2016, the Company has a loan receivable\nfrom Watagan of AUD$775 million (re-drawable up to\nAUD$1.36 billion) which is subject to impairment testing.\nThere is a guarantee provided by Yankuang Group Co., Ltd\n(being the ultimate parent entity of the Company) to indemnify\nthe Company for any amounts due and payable under the loan\nwhich are not paid by Watagan. However, it is noted that when\ncontrol over Watagan is regained, Watagan will be subject to\nbusiness combination accounting that will require the Company\nto fair value the assets and liabilities being acquired from\nWatagan at that time and, could result in a deficit to the value\nof the loan being recognised as a financial loss.\nInternal audit function\nThe internal audit function is managed by the Executive\nGeneral Manager (EGM) of Risk Management and Auditing.\nThat person has direct access to the chair of the Audit and Risk\nManagement Committee, as well as to the CEC, to whom he\ndirectly reports. The Audit and Risk Management Committee\nrecommends to the Board the appointment of the EGM Risk\nManagement and Auditing.\nWhere appropriate the internal audit function is supported\nprimarily by external consultants.\nThe EGM of Risk Management and Auditing has unfettered\naccess to the Audit and Risk Management Committee and its\nchair to seek information and explanations. The chair of the Audit\nand Risk Management Committee meets independently with the\nEGM Risk Management and Auditing.\nThe role of the EGM Risk Management and Auditing includes\nachievement of the internal audit objectives, risk management\npolicies and insurance strategy.\nAn annual program for internal audit and risk assurance\nis provided to the Audit and Risk Management Committee\nfor approval.

It also requires management\nto exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s\naccounting policies.\nThe Directors evaluate estimates and judgements incorporated\ninto these financial statements based on historical knowledge\nand best available current information. Estimates assume\na reasonable expectation of future events and are based on\ncurrent trends and economic data, obtained both externally\nand within the Company.\nThe resulting accounting estimates will, by definition,\nseldom equal the related actual results.\nDetails of critical accounting estimates and judgements can\nbe found in the notes to which they relate and include income\ntaxes B6, mining tenements C2, impairment of assets C3,\nexploration and evaluation assets C4, royalty receivable C9\nand provisions C10.\n(ix) Going concern\nFor the year ended 31 December 2016, the Group had a loss\nafter income tax of $227.1 million (31 December 2015: loss after\nincome tax of $291.2 million) from continuing operations.\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern\nbasis, which contemplates the continuation of normal business\noperations and the realisation of assets and settlement of\nliabilities in the normal course of business. The Directors have\nconsidered and noted the following with regards to the ability\nof the Group to continue as a going concern:\n(i)\t \u0007At 31 December 2016, the Group has a cash balance\nof $190.3 million;\n(ii)\t \u0007At 31 December 2016, the Group has surplus net current\nassets of $240.9 million;\n(iii) \u0007The Directors of Yanzhou Coal Mining Company Limited\n(“Yanzhou”) have provided financial support in the form\nof a A$1.4 billion facility (US$681.5 million drawn) to support\nthe on-going operations and the expansion of the Group\nto enable it to pay its debts as and when they fall due, and\na US$807 million facility (US$136.0 million drawn) for\nthe seven percent coupon distribution of the Subordinated\nCapital Notes in the first five years;\n(iv) \u0007The Directors of Yanzhou have provided a letter of support\nwhereby unless revoked by giving not less than 24 month’s\nnotice, for so long as Yanzhou owns at least 51 percent of the\nshares of Yancoal, Yanzhou will ensure that Yancoal continues\nto operate so that it remains solvent.\nOn the basis of these factors, the Directors believe that the going\nconcern basis of preparation is appropriate and the Group will\nbe able to repay its debts as and when they fall due. In the event\nthat the Group cannot continue as a going concern, it may not\nrealise its assets and settle its liabilities in the normal course of\noperations and at the amounts stated in the financial statements.",

Furthermore, the measure\nexcludes the effects of fair value re-measurements and foreign exchange gains/(losses) on interest-bearing liabilities.\nInterest income and expense are not allocated to the NSW and QLD segments, as this type of activity is driven by the\ncorporate function, which manages the cash position of the Group.\nA reconciliation of Operating EBIT to loss before income tax from continuing operations is provided as follows:\n(iii) Segment capitalised expenditure\nAmounts with respect to capital expenditure are measured in a manner consistent with that of the financial statements.\nReportable segment’s capital expenditure is set out in Note B1(a).

The Executive Committee\nreviews the liabilities of the Group at a consolidated level.\nB2: REVENUE\nAccounting policies\nRevenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Amounts disclosed as revenue are net of returns,\ntrade allowances, rebates and amounts collected on behalf of third parties.\nThe Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured and it is probable that future economic\nbenefits will flow to the entity. Revenue is recognised in the profit or loss as follows:\n(i) Sale of coal\nRevenue from the sale of coal is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed\nto the buyer and can be measured reliably. Risks and rewards are considered passed to the buyer at the time of delivery,\nusually on a Free On Board (“FOB”) basis. On occasion the sale of coal is recognised as the ship pulls into harbour\non a Free Alongside Ship (“FAS”) basis.",

      "text_content": "103\nANNUAL REPORT 2016\nB6: TAXATION\nAccounting policies\nThe income tax expense or benefit for the period is the tax\npayable on the current period’s taxable income based on the\napplicable income tax rate enacted or substantially enacted\nat the end of the reporting period for each jurisdiction,\nadjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities\nattributable to temporary differences and to unused tax losses.\nDeferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability\nmethod, on temporary differences arising between the tax\nbases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in\nthe consolidated financial statements. However, the deferred\nincome tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial\nrecognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other\nthan a business combination that at the time of the transaction\naffects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred\nincome tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that\nhave been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the\nreporting period and are expected to apply when the related\ndeferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income\ntax liability is settled.\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary\ndifferences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that\nfuture taxable amounts will be available to utilise those\ntemporary differences and losses. The carrying value of the\ndeferred tax asset is reviewed at each reporting period and\nreduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that future\ntaxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the asset to\nbe recovered.\nDeferred tax liabilities and assets are recognised for taxable\ntemporary differences between the carrying amount and tax\nbases of investments in controlled entities, except where the\nparent entity is able to control the timing of the reversal of the\ntemporary differences and it is probable that the differences\nwill not reverse in the foreseeable future.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is\na legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and\nliabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the\nsame taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities\nare offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right\nto offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise\nthe asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\nCurrent and deferred tax is recognised in the profit or loss,\nexcept to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other\ncomprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax\nis also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly\nin equity, respectively.\nTax consolidation legislation\nYancoal Australia Ltd and its wholly owned Australian\ncontrolled entities have implemented the tax consolidation\nlegislation for income tax purposes. The accounting policy in\nrelation to this legislation is set out in Note E3.\nCritical accounting estimates and judgements\nThe Group is subject to income taxes in Australia. Significant\njudgement is required in determining the provision for income\ntaxes. Deferred tax assets, including those arising from\nunutilised tax losses, require the Group to assess the likelihood\nthat the Group will generate sufficient taxable earnings\nin future periods, in order to utilise recognised deferred tax\nassets. Judgement is also required in respect of the application\nof existing tax laws. Assumptions about the generation of future\ntaxable profits depend on management’s estimates of future\ncash flows. These estimates of future taxable income are based\non forecast cash flows from operations (which are impacted by\nproduction and sales volumes, coal prices, reserves, operating\ncosts, closure and rehabilitation costs, capital expenditure, and\nother capital management transactions). To the extent that future\ncash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates,\nthe ability of the Group to realise the net deferred tax assets\nrecorded at the reporting date could be impacted. In addition,\nfuture changes in tax laws could limit the ability of the Group to\nobtain tax deductions in future periods.",

Subsequent costs are included\nin the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate\nasset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future\neconomic benefits associated with the item will flow to the\nGroup and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\nThe carrying amount of any component accounted for as\na separate asset is derecognised when replaced. All other\nrepairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the\nreporting period in which they are incurred. Mine development\nassets include all mining related development expenditure that\nis not included under land, buildings and plant and equipment.\nThe open pit operations capitalise mine development costs\nincluding both direct and indirect costs incurred to remove\noverburden and other waste materials to enable access to\nthe coal seams during the development of a mine before\ncommercial production commences, and during future\ndevelopment of new open pit mining areas. Amortisation\nof those capitalised costs over the life of the operation\ncommences at the time that commercial production begins for\nthe mine for the new open pit mining area. Underground mine\ndevelopment costs include both direct and indirect mining costs\nrelating to underground longwall panel development and mains\ndevelopment (primary access/egress roads for the mine).\nMains development costs are capitalised net of the coal sales\nrevenue earned from coal extracted as part of the mains\ndevelopment process. These capitalised costs are amortised\nover the life of the mine if the roads service the entire mine or\nover the life of the panels accessible from those mains if shorter\nthan the mine life.\nA regular review is undertaken of each area of interest to\ndetermine the appropriateness of continuing to carry forward\nmine development costs in relation to that area of interest.\nAccumulated costs in relation to an abandoned area are written\noff in full in the period in which the decision to abandon the\narea is made.\nOpen cut\nDuring the commercial production stage of open pit operations,\nproduction stripping costs comprises the accumulation of\nexpenses incurred to enable access to the coal seam, and includes\ndirect removal costs (inclusive of an allocation of overhead\nexpenditure) and machinery and plant running costs. Production\nstripping costs are capitalised as part of an asset, if it can be\ndemonstrated that it is probable that future economic benefits will\nbe realised, the costs can be reliably measured and the entity can\nidentify the component of the ore body for which access has been\nimproved. The asset is called “stripping activity asset” included in\nmine development.\nThe stripping activity asset is amortised on a systematic\nbasis, over the expected useful life of the identified component\nof the ore body that becomes more accessible as a result of the\nstripping activity. The units of production method shall be\napplied. Production stripping costs that do not satisfy the asset\nrecognition criteria are expensed.\nDepreciation and amortisation\nThe depreciable amount of all fixed assets, excluding freehold\nland, is depreciated on a straight-line or units of production\nbasis over the asset’s useful life to the Group based on life\nof mine plans and Joint Ore Reserves Committee “JORC”\nestimated reserves, commencing from the time the asset\nis held ready for use. Leased assets are depreciated over\nthe asset’s useful life or over the shorter of the asset’s useful\nlife and the lease term if there is no reasonable certainty\nthat the Group will obtain ownership at the end of the lease\nterm. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the period\nof the lease or estimated useful life, whichever is the shorter,\nusing the straight-line method.\nFor some assets, the useful life of the asset is linked to the\nlevel of production. In such cases, depreciation is charged on\na units of production basis based on the recoverable reserves\nor the remaining useful hours. Alternatively, the straight-line\nmethod may be used where this provides a suitable alternative\nbecause production is not expected to fluctuate significantly\nfrom one year to another. The estimated useful lives, residual\nvalues and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of\neach annual reporting period and any change in estimate\nis taken into account in the determination of remaining\ndepreciation charges.",

Amortisation\nis calculated over the life of the mine on a ‘units of production’ method based on the Joint Ore Reserves Committee (“JORC”)\nestimated reserves.\nChanges in the annual amortisation rate resulting from changes in the remaining estimated reserves, are applied on a prospective\nbasis from the commencement of the next financial year.

See Note C3 for further details\non the impairment of assets.\nCritical accounting estimates and judgements\nCoal Reserves and Resources\nThe Group estimates its coal Resources and Reserves based\non information compiled by Competent Persons as defined\nby the Australasian Code for Reporting Exploration Results,\nMineral Resources and Ore Reserves (December 2012), which\nis prepared by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee (“JORC”) of\nthe Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Australian\nInstitute of Geoscientists and Minerals Council of Australia,\nknown as the JORC 2012 Code, and Australian Security Exchange\n(“ASX”) Listing Rules 2012.\nMineral Resources and Ore Reserves are based on geological\ninformation and technical data relating to the size, depth,\nquality of coal, suitable production techniques and recovery\nrates. Such an analysis requires complex geological judgements\nto interpret the data. The estimation of Recoverable Reserves\nis based on factors such as estimates of foreign exchange\nrates, coal price, future capital requirements, rehabilitation\nobligations and production costs, along with geological\nassumptions and judgements made in estimating the size\nand quality of the reserves.\n31 December\n2016\n$M\n31 December\n2015\n$M\nOpening net book amount\n2,084.5\n2,466.2\nAcquisition through business combination\n25.1\nTransfers from exploration and evaluation assets\n100.9\nAmortisation for the period\n(57.8)\n(64.3)\nTransfer to assets classified as held for sale\n(342.5)\nClosing net book amount\n2,127.6\n2,084.5\nManagement forms a view of forecast sales prices based\non current and long-term historical average price trend.\nAs the economic assumptions used may change and as\nadditional geological information is produced during the\noperations of a mine, estimates of reserves may change.\nAdditionally the amount of reserves that may actually be mined\nin the future and the Group’s current reserve estimate may\nvary.

The recoverable amount is\nthe higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and\nvalue in use. Mining tenements and other non-financial\nassets (excluding goodwill) that have previously suffered\nan impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the\nimpairment at the end of each reporting period.\nFor the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped\ninto Cash-Generating Units (“CGU”), being the lowest levels\nfor which there are separately identifiable cash inflows which\nare largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets\nor groups of assets. For the purposes of goodwill impairment\ntesting, CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are\naggregated so that the level at which impairment is tested\nreflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for\ninternal reporting purposes. The goodwill acquired in a\nbusiness combination, for the purpose of impairment testing,\nis allocated to CGUs that are expected to benefit from the\nsynergies of the combination.\nThe Group assesses impairment by evaluation of conditions\nand events specific to the Company that may be indicative\nof impairment triggers.\n(ii) Other financial assets\nThe Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether\nthere is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of\nfinancial assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of\nfinancial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred\nonly if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one\nor more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the\nasset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact\non the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group\nof financial assets that can be reliably estimated.\nIf there is evidence of impairment for any of the Group’s financial\nassets carried at amortised cost, the loss is measured as the\ndifference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present\nvalue of estimated future cash flows, excluding future credit\nlosses that have not been incurred. The cash flows are discounted\nat the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The loss is\nrecognised in profit or loss.\nCritical accounting estimates and judgements\nThe determination of fair value and value in use requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions about expected\nproduction and sales volumes, coal prices (considering current\nand historical prices, price trends and related factors), foreign\nexchange rates, coal Resources and Reserves (refer to C2),\noperating costs, closure and rehabilitation costs and future\ncapital expenditure. These estimates and assumptions are subject\nto risk and uncertainty; hence there is a possibility that changes\nin circumstances will alter these projections, which may impact\nthe recoverable amount of the assets. In such circumstances,\nsome or all of the carrying amount of the assets may be further\nimpaired or the impairment charge reduced with the impact\nrecorded in the statement of profit or loss.",

The NSW regional\nCGU comprises the open cut mines Moolarben and Stratford/Duralie. Yarrabee and Middlemount are considered separate CGU’s due\nto location and ownership structure.\n(b) Assessment of fair value\nEach CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal has been determined using a discounted cash flow model over the expected\nlife on mine (10–25 years). The fair value model adopted has been categorised as level three in the fair value hierarchy.\nThe key assumptions in the model include:\nKey Assumptions\nDescription\nCoal prices\nThe Group’s cash flow forecasts are based on estimates of future coal prices, which assume\nbenchmark prices will revert to the group’s assessment of the long term real coal prices of USD\n66–USD 100 per tonne (2015: USD 55–USD 109 per tonne) for thermal and USD 104–USD\n165 per tonne (2015: USD 91–USD 166 per tonne) for metallurgical coal.\nThe Group receives long term forecast coal price data from multiple external sources\nwhen determining its benchmark coal price forecasts and then makes adjustments\nfor specific coal qualities.\nFor both thermal and metallurgical coal the Group’s forecast coal price is within\nthe range of external price forecasts.\nForeign exchange rates\nThe long term AUD/USD forecast exchange rate of $0.73 (2015: $0.73) is based on external\nsources. The year-end AUD/USD exchange rate was $0.72 per the Reserve Bank of Australia.\nProduction and capital costs\nProduction and capital costs are based on the Group’s estimate of forecast geological conditions,\nstage of existing plant and equipment and future production levels.\nThis information is obtained from internally maintained budgets, the five year business plan,\nlife of mine models, life of mine plans, JORC reports, and project evaluations performed by the\nGroup in its ordinary course of business.\nCoal Reserves and Resources\nSee discussion at Note C2 Mining tenements for how the coal reserves and resources\nare determined.\nDiscount rate\nThe Group has applied a post-tax discount rate of 10.5 percent (2015: 10.5 percent) to discount\nthe forecast future attributable post-tax cash flows.\nThe post-tax discount rate applied to the future cash flow forecasts represents an estimate\nof the rate the market would apply having regard to the time value of money and the risks specific\nto the asset for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted.\nThis rate is also consistent with the Group’s five year business plan, life of mine models\nand project evaluations performed in ordinary course of business.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n31 December 2016\nC: OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES",

These costs are only carried forward where\nthe right of tenure for the area of interest is current and to\nthe extent that they are expected to be recouped through\nsuccessful development and commercial exploitation, or\nalternatively, sale of the area, or where activities in the\narea have not yet reached a stage which permits reasonable\nassessment of the existence of economically recoverable\nreserves and active and significant operations in, or in\nrelation to, the area of interest are continuing.\nExploration and evaluation assets acquired in a business\ncombination are recognised at their fair value at the\nacquisition date. The carrying amount of exploration and\nevaluation assets are assessed for impairment when facts\nor circumstances suggest the carrying amount of the assets\nmay exceed their recoverable amount. A regular review\nis undertaken for each area of interest to determine the\nappropriateness of continuing to carry forward costs in\nrelation to each area of interest. Accumulated costs in relation\nto an abandoned area are written off in full in the period in\nwhich the decision to abandon the area is made. Once the\ntechnical feasibility and commercial viability of the extraction\nof mineral resources in an area of interest are demonstrable,\nthe exploration and evaluation assets attributable to that\narea of interest are first tested for impairment and then\nreclassified to mining tenements.\nCritical accounting estimates and judgements\nThe application of the Group’s accounting policy for\nexploration and evaluation expenditure requires judgement\nin determining whether it is likely that future economic\nbenefits are likely, which may be based on assumptions about\nfuture events or circumstances. Estimates and assumptions\nmay change if new information becomes available. If after\nexpenditure is capitalised information becomes available\nsuggesting that the recovery of expenditure is unlikely,\nthe amount capitalised is written off in the Consolidated\nStatement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income\nin the period when the new information becomes available.\nC3: IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS (CONTINUED)\n(b) Assessment of fair value (continued)\nBased on the above assumptions at 31 December 2016 the\nrecoverable amount is determined to be above book value\nfor all CGU’s resulting in no further impairment.\nImpairment provisions recorded as at 31 December 2016\nare $104.5 million for Moolarben and $73.8 million for\nStratford and Duralie. Moolarben and Stratford and Duralie\nare both included in the NSW region CGU. Management\nmay consider reversals of the impairment provision\npreviously recognised if there is either an increase in the\naverage long term real revenue over the life of the mine\ndue to either an increase in USD coal prices, or a further\nweakening of the AUD/USD foreign exchange rate or a\ncombination of both, or further reductions in the current\nand life of mine operating costs, capital expenditure\nrequirements, or an increase in the reserves.\nIn determining the value assigned to each key assumption,\nmanagement has used: external sources of information;\nthe expertise of external consultants; as well as the\nexperience of experts within the Group to validate entity\nspecific assumptions such as coal reserves and resources.\nAdditionally various sensitivities have been determined\nand considered with respect to each of the key assumptions,\nfurther supporting the above fair value conclusions.\n(c) Key sensitivity\nThe most sensitive input in the fair value model is forecast\nrevenue, which is primarily dependent on estimated future\ncoal prices and the AUD/USD forecast exchange rate.\nIf coal prices were -10 percent LOM the recoverable amount\nwould exceed book value for all CGUs. If the AUD/USD\nlong term forecast exchange rate was $0.80 the recoverable\namount would exceed book value for all CGUs.\nGoodwill\nThe Yarrabee goodwill was not subject to an impairment\ncharge as the recoverable amount is greater than the\ncarrying value for this CGU.",

Rehabilitation of these areas is ongoing and in some cases will contin-\nue until 2041. The provision for rehabilitation costs has been calculation based on the present value of the\nfuture costs expected to be incurred in restoring affected mining areas, assuming current technologies.\nKey estimate and judgement:\nThe rehabilitation provision has been created based on managements’ internal estimates and assumptions\nrelating to the current economic environment, which management believes is a reasonable basis upon which\nto estimate the future liability.\nThese estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions,\nhowever actual rehabilitation costs will ultimately depend upon the future market prices for the necessary\ndecommissioning works and the timing of when the rehabilitation costs are incurred. Timing is dependent\nupon when the mines ceases to produce at economically viable rates, which in turn, will depend upon future\ncoal prices, which are inherently uncertain.\nTake-or-pay\nIn acquiring part of a business or operation, an assessment is made on the fair value of the assets\nand liabilities under AASB 3 Business Combinations. Take-or-pay is the assessment of forecast excess\ncapacity for port and rail contracts. A provision was recognised for the discounted estimated excess\ncapacity. The provision has a finite life and will be released to profit or loss over the period in which\nexcess capacity is realised.\nKey estimate and judgement:\nThe provision is recognised and estimated based on management’s assessment of contracted port capacity\nversus forecast usage. This involves making assumptions about the probability, amount and timing of an\noutflow of resources embodying economic benefits.\nOther provisions\nThe provision includes marketing services fee payable to Noble Group Limited deemed above market norms\nand make good provisions to cover the cost to ‘make good’ any hired equipment, in case any major overhaul\ncosts are incurred at the end of the lease period.",

The Group’s\noverall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability\nof financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse\neffects on the financial performance of the Group. The Group\nuses derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange\ncontracts to hedge certain risk exposures. Derivatives are\nexclusively used for hedging purposes and not as speculative\ninstruments. The Group uses different methods to measure\ndifferent types of risk to which it is exposed. These methods\ninclude sensitivity analysis in the case of foreign exchange,\ninterest rate risk and other price risks, and aging analysis\nfor credit risk.\nThe Group holds the following financial instruments:\n(i)\nCash and cash equivalents;\n(ii)\nTrade and other receivables;\n(iii)\nTrade and other payables;\n(iv)\n\u0007Interest-bearing liabilities,\nincluding bank loans and finance leases;\n(v)\nAvailable-for-sale investments;\n(vi)\nRoyalty receivable;\n(vii)\t Derivative financial instruments; and\n(viii)\t Interest-bearing loan from associate.\nThe Board of Directors has overall responsibility for determining\nrisk management objectives and policies and risk management\nis carried out by the Group Audit and Risk Management\ndepartment along with the Group Treasury department.\nThe Board provides written principles for overall risk\nmanagement, as well as policies covering specific areas\nsuch as the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate\nforeign exchange risk. These derivative instruments create\nan obligation or right that effectively transfers one or more\nof the risks associated with an underlying financial instrument,\nasset or obligation.\nThe overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek\nto reduce risk and volatility in financial performance without\nunduly affecting competitiveness and flexibility. Further details\nregarding these policies are set out below.\n(a) Market risk\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as\nforeign exchange rates, interest rates, securities prices, and coal\nprices, will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings\nof financial instruments.\n(i) Foreign exchange risk\nThe Group operates entirely in Australia and its costs are\nprimarily denominated in its functional currency, the Australian\ndollar. Export coal sales are denominated in US dollars and a\nstrengthening of the Australian dollar against the US dollar\nhas an adverse impact on earnings and cash flow settlement.\nLiabilities for some plant and equipment purchases and loans are\ndenominated in currencies other than the Australian dollar and\na weakening of the Australian dollar against other currencies has\nan adverse impact on earnings and cash flow settlement.\nThe hedging policy of the Group aims to protect against the\nvolatility of cash expenditures or reduced collection in the above\nmentioned transactions as well as to reduce the volatility of profit\nor loss for retranslation of US dollar denominated loans at each\nperiod end.\nHedging through bank issued instruments\nOperating foreign exchange risk that arises from firm\ncommitments or highly probable transactions are managed\nthrough the use of bank issued forward foreign currency\ncontracts and collar option contracts. The Group hedges a\nportion of contracted US dollar sales and asset purchases settled\nin foreign currencies in each currency to mitigate the adverse\nimpact on cash flow due to the future rise or fall in Australian\ndollars against the relevant currencies.\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives\nthat are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised\nin Other Comprehensive Income in the hedging reserve until the\nanticipated underlying transaction occurs.",

In the current period, the loss relating to\nthe ineffective portion was $nil (2015: nil).\nNatural cash flow hedge\nThe Group currently does not use bank issued instruments to hedge foreign exchange risks in respect of US dollar denominated loans,\nhowever, the scheduled repayment of the principal on US dollar loans is designated to hedge the cash flow risks on the portion of\nforecast US dollar sales that are not hedged through bank issued instruments (“natural cash flow hedge”). US dollar loan repayments\nup to a six-month period are designated to hedge the forecast US dollar sales during the same period after the designation of the hedge\nrelationship based on a dollar for dollar basis until the hedge ratio reaches one.\nHedging effectiveness is determined by comparing the changes in the hedging instruments and hedged sales. Hedge ineffectiveness\nwill occur when cash flows generated by sales transactions are lower than the forecast sales transaction. In cases of hedge\nineffectiveness, gains or losses in relation to the excess portion in the foreign exchange movement of the designated US dollar loan\nrepayment will be recycled to profit or loss. The effective portion of changes in the hedging instruments will be recognised in the cash\nflow hedge reserve in Other Comprehensive Income. When the sales transactions occur, amounts accumulated in equity are recycled\nthrough the profit or loss as an increase or decrease to sales revenue.\nRoyalty receivable\nThe royalty receivable from the Middlemount Joint Venture is estimated based on expected future cash flows that are dependent\non sales volumes, US dollar denominated coal prices and the US dollar foreign exchange rate (refer to Note C9).\nThe Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk at the end of the reporting period, expressed in Australian dollars, was as follows:\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n31 December 2016\nD: CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING\n*\u0007The cash and cash equivalents balance in RMB was $0.5 million on 14 January 2016.

If all significant inputs required\nto fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level two. If one or more of the significant inputs is not\nbased on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. This is the case for the royalty receivable.",

Investments in associates are accounted for using\nthe equity method of accounting, after initially being recognised\nat cost. The Group’s investments in associates includes goodwill\nidentified on acquisition.\nThe Group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition profits\nor losses is recognised in profit or loss, and its share of\npost-acquisition other comprehensive income is recognised\nin other comprehensive income. The cumulative post-acquisition\nmovements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the\ninvestment. Dividends receivable from associates are recognised\nas a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment.\n(ii) Joint arrangements\nA joint arrangement is a contractual arrangement whereby\ntwo or more parties undertake economic activities under joint\ncontrol. Joint control exists only when the strategic, financial\nand operational policy decisions relating to the activities of the\njoint arrangement require the unanimous consent of the parties\nsharing control.\nA joint arrangement is either a joint operation or a joint venture.\nThe structure of each joint arrangement is analysed to determine\nwhether the joint arrangement is a joint operation or a joint\nventure. The classification of a joint arrangement is dependent\non the rights and obligations of the parties to the arrangement.\nJoint operations\nThe Group recognises its proportional right to the assets,\nliabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations and its\nshare of any jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenues\nand expenses. These have been incorporated in the financial\nstatements under the appropriate headings.\nJoint ventures\nA joint venture is structured through a separate vehicle\nand the parties have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.\nJoint ventures are accounted for using the equity method where\nthe assets and liabilities will be aggregated into one line item on\nthe face of the consolidated balance sheet, after adjusting for the\nshare of profit or loss after tax, which is shown as a separate line\nitem on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss\nand Other Comprehensive Income, after adjusting for amounts\nrecognised directly in equity.\nWhen the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals\nor exceeds its interest in the joint venture (which includes\nany long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the\nGroup’s net investment in the joint venture), the Group does\nnot recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations\nor made payments on behalf of the joint venture.\nUnrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint\nventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in\nthe joint ventures. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless\nthe transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset\ntransferred. Accounting policies of the joint ventures have been\nchanged where necessary, to ensure consistency with the policies\nadopted by the Group.\n(a) Joint operations\nA controlled entity, Moolarben Coal Mines Pty Limited, has\nan 81 percent interest in the Moolarben Joint Venture whose\nprincipal activity is the development and operation of open-cut\nand underground coal mines.\nA controlled entity, Yarrabee Coal Company Pty. Ltd., has\na 50 percent interest in the Boonal Joint Venture, whose\nprincipal activity is the provision of a coal haul road and\ntrain load out facility.\nThe principal place of business for the above joint operations\nis in Australia.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n31 December 2016\nE: GROUP STRUCTURE",

The Group has the right to appoint\na director and is currently represented on the Board to partake\nin policy-making processes.\nWatagan Mining Company Pty Limited\nDuring 2015 the Group established a 100 percent owned\nsubsidiary, Watagan Mining Company Pty Ltd (“Watagan”).\nOn 18 February 2016, the Group executed a Bond Subscription\nAgreement, together with other agreements (the “Watagan\nAgreements”) that, on completion, transferred the Group’s\ninterest in three of its 100 percent owned NSW coal mining\noperations, being the Austar, Ashton and Donaldson coal mines\n(the “three mines”), to Watagan for a purchase price of $1,363.4\nmillion (an amount equal to the book value of the three mines\nat completion). The purchase price was funded by way of a\n$1,363.4 million loan from Yancoal Australia Ltd to Watagan\nbearing interest at BBSY plus 7.06 percent with a maturity date\nof 1 April 2025. The outstanding interest and principal of this\nloan is guaranteed by Yankuang Group Co., Ltd (“Yankuang”),\nthe Group’s ultimate parent entity. The completion date of the\ntransaction was 31 March 2016.\nOn completion Watagan issued US$775 million of secured debt\nbonds with a term of approximately nine years to three external\nfinanciers (“Bondholders”). Watagan will issue up to a further\nUS$175 million of debt bonds to one of the Bondholders prior\nto 31 March 2017. The Bondholders will receive interest on the\nface value outstanding on the bonds comprising a fixed interest\ncomponent, as well as a variable interest component that is\ntied to the EBITDA performance of Watagan. Under the terms\nof the Watagan Agreements, it was determined that upon\nissuance of the bonds the Group lost control of Watagan.\nThis loss of control was determined to occur on the issuance\ndate of the bonds on the basis that the power over the key\noperating and strategic decisions of Watagan no longer reside\nwith the Group. Specifically, those powers were transferred\nto the Bondholders under the terms of the Watagan Agreements\nas the Bondholders were given control of Watagan’s board of\ndirectors via appointment of the majority of directors. This loss\nof control resulted in the Group de-consolidating the consolidated\nresults of Watagan from the transaction completion date and\nthe Group began to equity account for its 100 percent equity\ninterest in Watagan as an associate. At 31 December 2015 due\nto the Watagan transaction being near completion, and that the\ntransaction was considered to be highly likely, the three mines\nwere disclosed as Assets Classified as Held for Sale.",

Additionally, the Bondholders\nhave a put option that allows them to put the issued debt bonds\nto Yankuang at approximately years three, five, seven, and nine\nof the bond term, or on an event of default after year three.\nExercise of this put option would also result in the Group\nregaining control of Watagan.

The consolidated financial statements are\npresented in Australian dollars, which is the Group’s functional\nand presentation currency, except for Yancoal SCN Limited\nwhich has the US dollars as its functional currency.\nFor the purpose of presenting these consolidated financial\nstatements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign\noperations are translated into Australian dollars using exchange\nrates prevailing at the end of the reporting period. Income and\nexpense items are translated at the average exchange rates\nfor the period, unless exchange rates fluctuated significantly\nduring that period, in which case the exchange rates at the\ndates of the transactions are used. Exchange differences arising,\nif any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and\naccumulated in equity.\n(ii) Transactions and balances\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional\ncurrency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the\ntransactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from\nthe settlement of such transactions and from the translation\nat year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities\ndenominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or\nloss, except when they are deferred in equity as qualifying cash\nflow hedges.\nNon-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign\ncurrency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when\nthe fair value was determined. Translation differences on assets\nand liabilities carried at fair value are reported as part of the fair\nvalue gain or loss. Non-monetary items that are measured in\nterms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using\nthe exchange rate at the date of the transaction.\nF6: NEW AND AMENDED STANDARDS\nADOPTED BY THE GROUP\nThe Group was not required to change any of its accounting\npolicies as the result of new or revised accounting standards\nwhich became effective for the annual reporting period\ncommencing on 1 January 2016.

The Group’s assessment of the impact of these new standards\nand interpretations is set out below.\nReference\nand Title\nDetails of New Standard/Amendment/Interpretation\nApplication Date\nfor the Group\nAASB 9\nFinancial Instruments\nAmends the requirements for classification and measurement of financial assets. The available-for-sale\nand held-to-maturity categories of financial assets in AASB 139 have been eliminated. Under AASB 9,\nthere are three categories of financial assets:\na) Amortised cost\nb) Fair value through profit or loss\nc) Fair value through other comprehensive income.\nThe following requirements have generally been carried forward unchanged from AASB 139 Financial\nInstruments: Recognition and Measurement into AASB 9:\na) Classification and measurement of financial liabilities; and\nb) Derecognition requirements for financial assets and liabilities.\nHowever, AASB 9 requires that gains or losses on financial liabilities measured at fair value are recognised\nin profit or loss, except that the effects of changes in the liability’s credit risk are recognised in other\ncomprehensive income.\nImpact: Although the Directors anticipate that the adoption of AASB 9 may have an impact on the Group’s\nfinancial instruments, including hedging activity, it is impracticable at this stage to provide a reasonable\nestimate of such impact.\n1 January 2018\nAASB 16\nLeases\nThis standard introduces a single lessee accounting model that eliminates the requirement for leases\nto be classified as operating or finance leases. The main changes introduced by the new standard include:\na) Recognition of a right-to-use asset and liability for all leases (excluding short term leases with\n\u0007less than 12 months of tenure an leases relating to low value assets);\nb) Deprecation of right-to-use assets in-line with AASB 116 Property, plant and equipment in profit\nor loss and unwinding of the liability in principal and interest components;\nc) Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate are included in the initial measurement\nof the lease liability using the index or rate at the commencement date;\nd) By applying a practical expedient, a lessee is permitted to elect not to separate non-lease components\nand instead account all components as a lease; and\ne) Additional disclosure requirements.\nImpact: Although the Directors anticipate that the adoption of AASB 16 will impact the Group’s financial\nstatements, it is impracticable at this stage to provide a reasonable estimate of such impact.\n1 January 2018\nAASB 15\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nAn entity will recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an\namount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods\nor services. This means that revenue will be recognised when control of goods or services is transferred,\nrather than on transfer of risks and rewards as is currently the case under AASB 118 Revenue\nImpact: The Directors anticipate that the adoption of AASB 15 will be no impact on recognition of amounts\nin the Group’s financial statements, there will be additional disclosures required.\n1 January 2018\nAASB\n2014–1\nAmendments to Australian Accounting Standards (Part E)\nPart E of this Standard defers the application date of AASB 9: Financial Instruments (December 2010)\nto annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. This part also makes consequential\namendments to hedge accounting disclosures set out in AASB 7: Financial Instruments: Disclosures, and\nto AASB 132: Financial Instruments: Presentation to permit irrevocable designation of “own use contracts”\nas measured at fair value through profit or loss if the designation eliminates or significantly reduces an\naccounting mismatch.\nImpact: The Group is currently adhering to this standard and there is no material impact expected\non the Group’s financial report.\n1 January 2018",

The remaining gain or loss should be eliminated against the carrying amount\nof the remaining investment.\nThe application of AASB 2014–10 will result in a change in accounting policies for transactions\nof loss of control over subsidiaries (involving an associate or joint venture) that are businesses\nper AASB 3 for which gains or losses were previously recognised only to the extent of the unrelated\ninvestor’s interest.\nImpact: The Group is currently adhering to this standard and there is no material impact expected\non the Group’s financial report.\n1 January 2018\nAASB 2016–1\nAmendments to Australian Accounting Standards—Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets\nfor Unrealised Losses\nThis standard clarifies that deferred tax asset recognition on unrealised losses arising from assets\nmeasured at fair value in the financial statements should be done after taking in to account any restrictions\nimposed under tax laws on the source of taxable profits against which the deductible temporary\ndifferences can be offset. Further the future taxable profits should not include any amounts that are reversal\nof the deductible temporary differences.\nImpact: The Group is currently adhering to this standard and there is no material impact expected\non the Group’s financial report.\n1 January 2017\nAASB 2016–2\nAmendments to Australian Accounting Standards—Disclosure Initiative:\nAmendments to AASB 107\nThe amendment to AASB 107 introduces additional disclosures that will enable users of financial statements\nto evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities. The amendment requires disclosure of\nchanges arising from:\n•\t Cash flows, such as drawdowns and repayments of borrowings, and\n•\t Non-cash changes, such as acquisitions, disposals and unrealised exchange differences.\nImpact: The Group is currently adhering to this standard and there is no material impact expected\non the Group’s financial report.\n1 January 2017\nAASB 2016–5\nAmendments to Australian Accounting Standards—Classification and Measurement\nof Share-based Payment Transactions\nThis standard provides guidance on treatment of vesting conditions in a cash-settled share based\npayment arrangement that are similar to what has been prescribed for equity settled share based payment\narrangements. It also clarifies that, subject to certain exceptions, share based payment transactions with\nnet-settlement feature on account of withholding tax obligations should be classified in entirety as equity\nsettled share based payment.\nImpact: Since the group does not have a policy of cash-settled share based awards or net-settlement\nfeatures in equity settled plans, this standard is not expected to impact the Group’s financial statements.\n1 January 2018",

Yancoal remains committed to proactively\n\n\nimproving the systems and processes employed across sites to\n\n\neducate, communicate and record employee safety initiatives.\n\n\nIn April 2016 Yancoal and the Austar [1] operation received formal\n\n\nnotification from the Department of Industry, Resources and\n\n\nEnergy confirming it would not be instituting prosecution\n\n\nproceedings related to the investigation into the Austar\n\n\nunderground incident of 15 April 2014.\n\n\n\nIn August 2016, a small coal burst occurred in the main working\n\n\narea of the Austar underground mine. Following a thorough and\n\n\nimmediate review by Yancoal (in its capacity as the management\n\n\nservices provider to Austar mine) and the relevant New South\n\n\nWales Government departments, the Austar mine implemented\n\n\nadditional safety barriers and controls in the working area prior\n\n\nto the resumption of mining.\n\n\nUnder the direction of the Health, Safety, Environment\n\n\nand Community Committee, Yancoal continues to build the\n\n\nleadership, capabilities, systems and reporting procedures\n\n\nrequired to deliver on its objectives of achieving zero harm\n\n\nat its operations.\n\n\n**Financial performance**\n\n\nThe loss after income tax for the year ended 31 December 2016\n\n\namounted to $227.1 million (31 December 2015: $291.2 million).\n\n\nSignificant global thermal coal market price improvements and\n\n\nthe establishing of 2016 industry-high quarterly benchmark\n\n\nprices for semi-soft coking and PCI coal during the second half,\n\n\ndrove sales volume increases and earnings improvements for the\n\n\nfourth quarter of the reporting period.\n\n\nYancoal responded to sustained low coal prices and existing\n\n\noperating cash flow constraints in the first half of the year via\n\n\na debt funding arrangement and transfer of control of the Austar,\n\n\nAshton and Donaldson operations to a newly established Yancoal\n\n\nsubsidiary, Watagan Mining Company Pty Ltd (“Watagan”),\n\n\nas announced 17 February 2016.\n\n\nCost reduction strategies continued to be supported at all\n\n\noperations, with the Moolarben Stage Two project delivering\n\n\ncritical development and construction goals on time and on\n\n\nbudget, including the commencement of development coal from\n\n\nthe new Moolarben underground and opening of the new open\n\n\ncut box cut.\n\n\nThroughout 2016, Yancoal continued to restructure its\n\n\noperations, maximise blending across the New South Wales\n\n\nmine sites (operated and managed), and proactively managed\n\n\nits existing take-or-pay arrangements.\n\n\n\n1.

The interruptions to mining resulting\n\n\nin total ROM coal production of 1.2Mt (2015 1.9Mt) and saleable\n\n\ncoal production of 0.9Mt (2015 1.4Mt) for the reporting period.\n\n\nQueensland\n\n\nYarrabee (Yancoal 100 percent ownership) maintained\n\n\nconsistently strong production rates throughout the reporting\n\n\nperiod, overcoming detrimental wet weather impacts and\n\n\nflooding conditions in the first quarter of the year, to deliver\n\n\nabove targets with a total ROM coal production of 3.6Mt (2015\n\n\n3.4Mt) and total saleable coal production of 3.1Mt (2015 2.8Mt).\n\n\nYarrabee’s increased production output in the second half of\n\n\nthe year benefitted from positive changes made to existing shift\n\n\narrangements, supported by established fleet and Coal Handling\n\n\nand Processing Plant efficiencies introduced in the year prior.\n\n\nThe Middlemount joint venture (Yancoal ~50 percent\n\n\nownership) maintained steady production rates throughout\n\n\n2016, overcoming similar wet weather impacts experienced\n\n\nat Yancoal’s Yarrabee operation, to produce total annual ROM\n\n\ncoal production of 5.3Mt (2015 5.5Mt) and total saleable coal\n\n\nproduction of 4.1Mt (2015 4.1Mt).\n\n\n\nWatagan-controlled [3]\n\n\nAshton (Yancoal 100 percent ownership [3] ) achieved total\n\n\nROM coal production of 2.4Mt (2015 3.0Mt) and saleable\n\n\ncoal production of 1.1Mt (2015 1.4Mt) for the year.\n\n\nOn 20 June 2016, the NSW Planning and Assessment\n\n\nCommission (PAC) granted approval for the Ashton Mod five\n\n\n(integration modification). The modification enables Ashton\n\n\nto increase underground production from 2.95Mt per annum\n\n\nROM to 5.0Mt per annum ROM and contemporise the\n\n\nconditions of the existing Ashton coal mine.\n\n\nAustar (Yancoal 100 percent ownership [3] ) development coal\n\n\nproduction rates throughout 2016 were buoyed by significant\n\n\nimprovements in longwall production during the second half,\n\n\nto achieve total ROM coal production of 1.2Mt (2015 0.8Mt)\n\n\nand saleable coal production of 1.1Mt (2015 0.7Mt).\n\n\nProduction gains achieved in the second half offset an\n\n\nunscheduled shutdown of the longwall in August, following\n\n\na small coal burst in the main working area.\n\n\nThe Donaldson (Yancoal 100 percent ownership [3] ) operation’s\n\n\nAbel underground mine produced a total 0.3Mt of ROM coal\n\n\n(2015 1.8Mt) and 0.2Mt (2015 1.3Mt) of saleable coal for the\n\n\nreporting period, in accordance with expectations. As announced\n\n\n2 May 2016, the Donaldson coal operation was moved to ‘care\n\n\nand maintenance’, with mining ceasing at the Abel underground\n\n\nmine in June 2016 and commencing new feasibility studies.\n\n\n**Infrastructure**\n\nNewcastle Infrastructure Group (“NCIG”) Coal Terminal\n(Yancoal 27 percent)\n\n\nYancoal continues to be one of five company shareholders\n\n\ninvolved in the $2.5 billion NCIG export coal terminal\n\n\nin Newcastle, New South Wales.

REMUNERATION PRINCIPLES AND FRAMEWORK**\n\n\nThe Company’s governing principles for remuneration are:\n\n\n- To ensure remuneration is equitable, aligned with the long term\n\n\ninterests of the Company and its shareholders and complies\n\n\nwith relevant Company policies, including the Diversity Policy;\n\n\n- To provide market competitive remuneration and conditions to\n\n\nattract and retain skilled and motivated employees;\n\n\n- To structure short and long term incentives that are challenging\n\n\nto create sustainable returns and to support the achievement of\n\n\nthe Company’s strategies and objectives; and\n\n\n- To reward based on performance, in particular acknowledging\n\n\nthe contribution of outstanding performers.\n\n\n**2.1 Remuneration governance framework**\n\n\nConsistent with its Board Charter, the Board oversees the\n\n\nappointment, remuneration and performance of all Key\n\n\nManagement Personnel (“KMP”) other than Directors and,\n\n\nother members of the Executive Committee. On these issues,\n\n\nthe Board receives recommendations from the Nomination\n\n\nand Remuneration Committee.\n\n\n58\n\n\n\nThe Nomination and Remuneration Committee’s objective\n\n\nis to assist the Board by making recommendations in relation to:\n\n\n- Board composition and succession planning for the Board;\n\n\n- Remuneration levels and structure for KMP, and other members\n\n\nof the Executive Committee as appointed from time to time;\n\n\n- The public reporting of remuneration for KMP, and other\n\n\nmembers of the Executive Committee;\n\n\n- The performance assessment of the Executive Committee;\n\n\n- Designing Company remuneration policy and regulations\n\n\nwith regard to corporate governance; and\n\n\n- Diversity.\n\n\nIt had been intended to review the Long Term Incentive Plan\n\n\n(“LTIP”) during 2016, however due to more pressing priorities\n\n\nthe review has been postponed until 2017. As Yancoal stabilises\n\n\nand develops a sustainable business model to be a major and\n\n\ncompetitive force in the mining sector in Australia it will be\n\n\nimportant to consider an appropriate employee long term\n\n\nincentive scheme for the company. It is well recognised that long\n\n\nterm incentive schemes for employees of the company can drive\n\n\nlong term positive value for the Shareholders. Having a LTIP\n\n\nfor employees tends to lead to better overall performance by the\n\n\ncompany which in turn incentivises all employees of the company.\n\n\nWe intend to explore and develop an appropriate LTIP proposal\n\n\nfor Senior Yancoal Employees for consideration of the Board.\n\n\nThis will be proposed via the Nomination and Remuneration\n\n\nCommittee in 2017.\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\n**3. EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION**\n\n\nThe Executive remuneration structure below is an appropriate\n\n\nreflection of Yanzhou’s majority shareholding in the Company.\n\n\n**3.1 Objective**\n\n\nRemuneration frameworks for Executives are structured\n\n\nto be market competitive and to reflect the reward strategy\n\n\nof the organisation. Through these frameworks the Company\n\n\nseeks to align remuneration for Executives with:\n\n\nShareholders' interests by:\n\n\n- Making economic performance a core component of the overall\n\n\nremuneration plan design;\n\n\n- Focusing on the key value drivers of the business including\n\n\nemployee safety, operational performance and cost control; and\n\n\n- Attracting and retaining high calibre executives.\n\n\n**TABLE 2: Executive remuneration structure**\n\n\n\nExecutive’s interests by:\n\n\n- Rewarding capability and experience;\n\n\n- Reflecting competitive reward for contribution to growth\n\n\nin company performance;\n\n\n- Providing a clear structure for earning rewards; and\n\n\n- Providing recognition for contribution.\n\n\nDetails of remuneration for all Executives are set out in Table 11\n\n\n(See Section 6: Remuneration tables).\n\n\n**3.2 Structure**\n\n\nAll remuneration frameworks for Executives are structured\n\n\nas a combination of fixed and variable remuneration, as follows:\n\n\n\n**Fixed remuneration** - Fixed Annual Remuneration (“FAR”), including cash salary, superannuation, and may include car\nallowance; and\n\n\n                                Other benefits (see Section 3.4).\n\n\n\n**Variable remuneration**\n**(‘at risk’)**\n\n\n**3.3 Remuneration mix**\n\n\n\n\n- Short-term Incentive (see Section 3.5.1)\n\n\n- Special Incentive Scheme (see Section 3.5.2), and\n\n\n- Long-term Incentive (see Section 3.5.3).\n\n\n\nThe relative proportion of remuneration entitlement for Executives that is fixed (excluding benefits) and that which is linked\n\n\nto individual or Company performance or both (referred to as ‘at risk’) is as follows:\n\n\n**TABLE 3: Proportion of Executives’ remuneration entitlement at risk**\n\n\n\n\n\nBoyun Xu is an Executive Director of Yancoal, however his executive role relates to Yancoal International (Holding) Co., Ltd (“YIH”). Mr Xu’s remuneration is paid for by YIH\n\nand as such he is not considered a senior executive of Yancoal.\n\n\nA\nCalculations for fixed remuneration entitlement exclude the value of benefits, see table 3 and table 11;\n\nB The short term variable remuneration entitlement is determined pursuant to the Short Term Incentive Plan (outlined in section 3.5.1);\n\nC The Special Incentive Scheme is outlined in section 3.5.2;\n\nD The Long Term Incentive Plan is outlined in section 3.5.3.\n\n\n59\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\n_Directors’ Report_\n\n\n**3.4 Fixed Remuneration**\n\n\nFixed remuneration comprises cash salary, superannuation\n\n\nand other benefits. In recognition of the Company’s financial\n\n\nperformance, no fixed remuneration increases were awarded in\n\n\n2016. Executives receive a salary package, in the form of a FAR\n\n\npackage, which incorporates cash salary, superannuation benefits\n\n\nand may include a provision for a car allowance, together with\n\n\ncertain other benefits.\n\n\nSenior Executives’ level of fixed remuneration is set to provide a\n\n\nbase level of remuneration which is appropriate to the position\n\n\nand competitive with companies in a similar industry. Each year\n\n\nExecutives’ FAR is reviewed by reference to the Coal Mining\n\n\nIndustry Remuneration Report produced by McDonald &\n\n\nCompany (Australasia) Pty Ltd (“McDonald Report”). Using the\n\n\nMcDonald Report, the Company’s Remuneration Policy targets\n\n\nFAR at the 75th percentile of the relevant industry benchmark\n\n\nwhich reflects market practice in the coal industry in Australia.\n\n\nHaving regard to the specific characteristics of the role, each\n\n\nemployment position is then assigned a Job Salary Rate (“JSR”),\n\n\nand Executives are paid at between 80 percent and 120 percent\n\n\nof the JSR.\n\n\nSenior Executives’ superannuation benefits are paid to their\n\n\nnominated superannuation fund in accordance with relevant\n\n\nstate and industry legislation. No Executives are entitled to a\n\n\nguaranteed increase in FAR. Senior Executives may receive\n\n\ncertain benefits as part of their fixed remuneration including car\n\n\nparking, travel allowances and relocation allowances. Executives\n\n\nhave some scope to determine the combination of cash (including\n\n\ncar allowance) and certain non-monetary benefits by which their\n\n\nFAR is delivered, provided that it does not create undue cost for\n\n\nthe Company.\n\n\n**3.5 Variable remuneration**\n\n\nVariable remuneration is delivered through participation in the\n\n\nSTI Plan (as outlined in section 3.5.1) and a Special Incentive\n\n\nScheme (as outlined in section 3.5.2). Certain Executives are also\n\n\neligible to participate in a LTI Plan (as outlined in section 3.5.3).\n\n\n**3.5.1 Short Term Incentive Plan**\n\n\nEligibility\n\n\nThe STI Plan applies to Executives as well as to the broader\n\n\nmanagement and employees of the Company.\n\n\n60\n\n\n\nObjective\n\n\nThe objective of the STI Plan is to reward Executives and\n\n\nemployees for the achievements of the Company, Business Unit\n\n\nand individual goals that are aligned to the Company’s financial,\n\n\noperational and strategic priorities.\n\n\nStructure\n\n\nFor 2016 the STI Plan comprised three key components:\n\n\n1. STI opportunity—this is expressed as a percentage of the\n\n\nExecutive’s FAR. The STI opportunity is reviewed annually.\n\n\nA benchmarking exercise is completed against comparable\n\n\npeers in listed companies, and no changes were proposed for\n\n\n2016. The CEO has an agreed STI opportunity of between a\n\n\nminimum of 75 percent and a maximum of 126 percent of FAR\n\n\nfor 2016. The Board believes this level of STI opportunity is\n\n\nreasonable and competitive for the current environment.\n\n\n2. STI Scorecard—this consists of a number of Key Performance\n\n\nIndicators (“KPIs”). For the Executives named in this report,\n\n\nall KPIs are measured at the Company level. The KPIs fall\n\n\ninto the following categories TRIFR (Total Recordable Injury\n\n\nFrequency Rate) (20 percent weighting), Environment (10\n\n\npercent weighting), FOR (Free On Rail) Cash Costs (35 percent\n\n\nweighting), Profitability (20 percent weighting) and Specific\n\n\nBusiness Unit Measures (15 percent).) Details of how the\n\n\nSTI Scorecard is evaluated are set out below. STI scorecard\n\n\nperformance is assessed by the Chairman of the Executive\n\n\nCommittee and the Chief Executive Officer, reviewed by the\n\n\nNomination and Remuneration Committee, and approved by\n\n\nthe Board.\n\n\n3. Individual Performance—this is measured by Key\n\n\nResult Areas (“KRA”). These KRAs are aligned to the\n\n\nExecutive’s role and include areas such as special projects,\n\n\nachievement of operating and capital expenditure budgets,\n\n\nand achievement of growth/continuous improvement\n\n\ninitiatives. Based on performance against the KRAs, the\n\n\nExecutive receives a performance rating at the end of the year\n\n\non a scale from Exceptional to Below Standard. In the case of\n\n\nthe Chief Executive Officer, individual performance is assessed\n\n\nby the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, to be\n\n\nendorsed by the Board. For all other Executives, performance\n\n\nis assessed by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chair of the\n\n\nExecutive Committee.\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\nAt the start of each year, KPIs and KRAs are reviewed and\n\n\nselected by the Board as being the most appropriate to the\n\n\nbusiness. Assessment against these measures is determined\n\n\nfollowing the end of each year.\n\n\nPerformance against the STI Scorecard and the Individual KRAs\n\n\nare converted to two payout multipliers, and applied to the\n\n\nTarget STI opportunity to determine the actual STI award.\n\n\nAccordingly, the Executive’s STI award is heavily influenced by\n\n\nthe achievement of Company KPIs.\n\n\n\n**Further detail on the STI Scorecard 2016**\n\n\nThe STI Scorecard measures the Company’s performance in\n\n\nrespect of Profitability, Health, Safety and Environment and\n\n\nSpecific Business Unit measures.\n\n\n2016 STI outcome\n\n\nSTI outcomes are calculated by multiplying the target STI\n\n\nopportunity by the STI Scorecard payout multiplier and the\n\n\nindividual performance payout multiplier. Any STI award is\n\n\ndelivered as a cash payment around April each year.\n\n\n\n**TABLE 4: Company Performance against STI Scorecard in 2016**\n\n\n**Actual Performance**\n**STI Scorecard Category** **STI Scorecard** **STI Weighting** **Against KPI**\n\nProfitability Profit Before Tax (“PBT”) 20% 197%\n\n\nFOR Cash Costs 35% 111%\n\n\nHSE TRIFR (Total recordable injury frequency rate) 20% 105%\n\n\nEnvironment 10% 0%\n\n\nBusiness Unit measures Two business unit measures customised to each 15% 114%\n\nExecutive’s role\n\n\nThe assessed outcomes and average achievement for the company of 134 percent reflects the following achievements in 2016:\n\n\n(a) \u0007The overall delivery of Profit Before Tax for the Group and the assets managed on behalf of Yancoal International Holdings (“YIH”)\n\n\nof $230M ahead of budget; and\n\n\n(b) \u0007Sizeable reductions in the key measure of FOR Cash Cost per ton across most sites; and\n\n\n(c) \u0007The average achievement of 114 percent for each Business Unit measure;\n\n\nEnvironment measures include environmental complaints and incidents.\n\n\n**3.5.2 Special Incentive Scheme**\n\n\nAs reported in the 2015 Annual report this is a one off scheme for 2015 and is distributed to employees via three tranches;\n\n\none third in Year one, one third in Year two and one third in Year three.

To the extent appropriate to the scale\n\n\nand nature of the Company’s business, the Company has adopted\n\n\nthe 3rd edition of the ASX Corporate Governance Council’s\n\n\nPrinciples and Recommendations (ASX Recommendations).\n\n\nThis statement sets out the Company’s compliance with the 3rd\n\n\nedition of the ASX Recommendations, and the main corporate\n\n\ngovernance policies and practices adopted by the Company.\n\n\n**Principle 1: Lay solid foundations**\n**for management and oversight**\n\n\nRole of the board\n\n\nThe Board is responsible for the overall corporate governance\n\n\nof the Company including directing the affairs of the Company,\n\n\nsetting and monitoring the Company’s risk management strategy\n\n\nand overseeing the appointment, remuneration and performance\n\n\nof senior executives. The Board is committed to maximising\n\n\nperformance, generating appropriate levels of shareholder value\n\n\nand financial return, and sustaining the growth and success\n\n\nof the Company. The Board’s role and responsibilities and its\n\n\ndelegation of authority to standing committees and senior\n\n\nexecutives have been formalised in a Board Charter. The Board\n\n\nCharter can be found within the Corporate Governance section\n\n\nof the Company’s website.\n\n\nThe Board Charter sets out the procedure by which the Board\n\n\ncollectively, and each individual director, can seek independent\n\n\nprofessional advice at the Company’s expense.\n\n\nDelegation to management\n\n\nThe Board delegates responsibility for the day to day\n\n\nmanagement of the Company’s affairs and implementation of\n\n\nthe strategy and policy initiatives set by the Board to the Chair\n\n\nof the Executive Committee (CEC), the Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n(CEO) and other senior executives.

All directors have\n\n\ndirect access to the Company Secretary. The Board Charter sets\n\n\nout the other duties of the Company Secretary, which include\n\n\nbeing responsible for:\n\n\n- Ensuring compliance by the Company with the Company’s\n\n\nconstitution, the provisions of the Corporations Act and other\n\n\napplicable laws as they relate to the Company;\n\n\n- Providing corporate governance advice to the Board;\n\n\n- Ensuring that the Company’s books and registers required by\n\n\nthe Corporations Act are established and properly maintained;\n\n\n- Ensuring that all notices and responses are lodged with ASIC\n\n\nand ASX on time; and\n\n\n- Organising and attending shareholder meetings and directors’\n\n\nmeetings, including sending out notices, preparing agendas,\n\n\nmarshalling proxies and compiling minutes.\n\n\nNomination and appointment of directors\n\n\nThe Board considers that Board succession planning, and\n\n\nthe progressive and orderly renewal of the Company’s Board\n\n\nmembership, are an important part of the governance process.\n\n\nThe Board’s policy for the selection, appointment and\n\n\nre-appointment of directors is to ensure that the Board possesses\n\n\nan appropriate range of skills, experience and expertise to enable\n\n\nthe Board to carry out its responsibilities most effectively.\n\n\nAs part of this appointment and re-appointment process,\n\n\nthe directors consider Board renewal and succession plans\n\n\nand whether the Board’s size and composition is conducive\n\n\nto making appropriate decisions.\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\nAt the time of appointment of a new Non-Executive Director,\n\n\nthe key terms and conditions relevant to that person’s\n\n\nappointment, the Board’s responsibilities and the Company’s\n\n\nexpectations of a director are set out in a letter of appointment.\n\n\nThe Board has established a Nomination and Remuneration\n\n\nCommittee to make recommendations to the Board on matters\n\n\nsuch as succession plans for the Board, the size and composition\n\n\nof the Board, potential candidates for appointment to the Board,\n\n\nre-election of directors, Board induction and Board evaluation\n\n\nprocedures. The structure and membership of the Nomination\n\n\nand Remuneration Committee is described further under\n\n\nPrinciples two and eight.\n\n\nThe Board recognises that people are its most important\n\n\nasset and is committed to the maintenance and promotion of\n\n\nworkplace diversity. Whilst traditionally, experience as a senior\n\n\nexecutive or director of a large organisation with international\n\n\noperations is a prerequisite for candidature, in accordance with\n\n\nthe Diversity Policy, the Board also seeks skills and experience\n\n\nin the following areas:\n\n\n- Marketing and sales;\n\n\n- Policy and regulatory development and reform;\n\n\n- Health, safety and environment and social responsibility; and\n\n\n- Human resources.\n\n\nIn identifying candidates, the Nomination and Remuneration\n\n\nCommittee will consider and select nominees by reference to a\n\n\nnumber of selection criteria including the skills, expertise and\n\n\nbackground that add to and complement the range of skills,\n\n\nexpertise and background of the existing directors, the capability\n\n\nof the candidate to devote the necessary time and commitment\n\n\nto the role, potential conflicts of interest and independence,\n\n\nand the extent to which the candidate would fill a present need\n\n\non the Board. Where appropriate, the appropriate checks are\n\n\nundertaken prior to a director being appointed. The mix of skills\n\n\ncurrently held by the Board is set out under Principle 2.\n\n\nThe role, rights and responsibilities and membership\n\n\nrequirements of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee,\n\n\ntogether with the selection criteria for candidates for the Board,\n\n\nare set out in the Nomination and Remuneration Committee\n\n\nCharter which can be found within the Corporate Governance\n\n\nsection of the Company’s website.\n\n\n\nShareholder approval is required for the appointment of\n\n\ndirectors. However, directors may appoint other directors to fill\n\n\na casual vacancy where the number of directors falls below the\n\n\nconstitutional minimum number of directors and in order to\n\n\ncomply with any applicable laws, regulations or the ASX Listing\n\n\nRules. If a director is appointed to fill a casual vacancy in these\n\n\ncircumstances, the approval of members must be sought at the\n\n\nnext general meeting.\n\n\nNo director may hold office without re-election beyond the third\n\n\nannual general meeting (AGM) following the meeting at which\n\n\nthe director was last elected or re-elected. The Company provides\n\n\nall material information in its possession in relation to directors\n\n\nstanding for election or re-election in the Notice of Meeting\n\n\nprovided to shareholders prior to the AGM.\n\n\nTo the extent that the ASX Listing Rules require an election of\n\n\ndirectors to be held and no director would otherwise be required\n\n\nunder the Company’s Constitution to submit for election or\n\n\nre-election at an AGM, the director who has been the longest in\n\n\noffice since their last election or appointment must retire at the\n\n\nAGM. As between directors who were last elected or appointed\n\n\non the same day, where it is not agreed between the relevant\n\n\ndirectors, the director to retire must be decided by lot.\n\n\nThe process for appointment, retirement and re-election of\n\n\ndirectors is set out in the Company’s Constitution which can\n\n\nbe found within the Corporate Governance section of the\n\n\nCompany’s website.\n\n\nDiversity\n\n\nThe Company recognises that people are its most important\n\n\nasset and is committed to the maintenance and promotion\n\n\nof workplace diversity. The Company has adopted a Diversity\n\n\nPolicy, approved by the Board, to actively facilitate a more diverse\n\n\nand representative management and leadership structure. The\n\n\nDiversity Policy is available in the Corporate Governance section\n\n\nof the Company’s website.\n\n\nAnnually, the Board establishes measurable objectives with\n\n\nthe assistance of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee\n\n\nwith a view to progressing towards a balanced representation\n\n\nof women at a Board and senior management level. Performance\n\n\nagainst these measurable objectives are reviewed annually by the\n\n\nNomination and Remuneration Committee as part of its annual\n\n\nreview of the effectiveness of the Diversity Policy.\n\n\n71\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\n_Corporate Governance Statement_\n\n\nThe measurable objectives adopted for 2016 and the Company’s performance against the measurable objectives\n\n\nare outlined in the table below:\n\n\n**Objective** **Performance**\n\n\n\n1.

These sessions were aimed at promoting a bullying and harassment\nfree environment, encouraging all employees to speak up about incidents and to ensure that\nthe Company’s culture is aligned to Yancoal values and behaviours.\n\n\nEmployees across the organisation have access to the Company’s Code of Conduct\nvia the Company intranet and are reminded of this via inductions, crew talks and as relevant\nissues arise.\n\n\nAcross the Yancoal group, merit-based, non-discriminatory practices are adhered to in the\nrecruitment of new employees.\n\n\nOur Human Resources team is actively involved with management in the process of recruiting\nnew employees, including being involved in interviews of potential employers, coaching and\nmentoring on targeted selection techniques and merit-based selection, as well as ensuring\ngeneral diversity awareness with regards to candidates.\n\n\nThe “Yancoal Way” continues to be rolled out across the Group. The message of continuous\nimprovement and ‘blue bus’ thinking is promoted during recruitment, induction and performance\nreviews to promote a culture that encourages engagement, diversity and continuous learning.\n\n\nThe Board\n\n\n\nGender has been identified as a key area of focus for\n\n\nthe Company. On an annual basis, the Nomination and\n\n\nRemuneration Committee reviews the proportion of women\n\n\nemployed by the Company and submits a report to the Board\n\n\noutlining its findings. Details regarding the proportion of men\n\n\nand women throughout the organisation are set out below.\n\n\nDuring 2016, the proportion of women who were directly\n\n\nemployed by the Company as a whole was 10 percent:\n\n\n171 Full-time, five Part-time and 10 Casual, a decrease\n\n\nof 1.0 percent from 2015. The proportion of women in senior\n\n\nmanagement roles (being roles which directly report to the\n\n\nCEO or CEC) within the Company during 2016 was eight\n\n\npercent: Women held one of 12 senior management roles\n\n\nwithin the Company.\n\n\nThere are no women on the Company’s Board.\n\n\nPerformance of the Board, its committees\n\nand individual directors\n\n\nThe Nomination and Remuneration Committee oversees an\n\n\nannual evaluation process for the Board, its committees and each\n\n\ndirector based on the Board Performance Evaluation Protocol\n\n\n(Protocol) adopted and approved by the Board in 2012.\n\n\n72\n\n\n\nPeriodically, a review of the structure and operation of the Board,\n\n\nthe skills and characteristics required by the Board to maximise\n\n\nits effectiveness and whether the mix of skills, experience\n\n\nand expertise and the Board’s practices and procedures are\n\n\nappropriate for the present and future needs of the Company\n\n\nis conducted. This evaluation of performance of the Board may\n\n\nbe conducted with the assistance of an external facilitator.\n\n\nAs set out in the Board Charter, the review of the Board involves\n\n\ndirectors providing written feedback on the Board’s performance\n\n\nto the Chairman or to an external facilitator, which in turn is\n\n\ndiscussed by the Board, with consideration of whether any\n\n\nsteps for improvement are required.\n\n\nIt is expected that externally facilitated reviews will occur\n\n\napproximately every three years. The independent external\n\n\nfacilitator will seek input from each of the Directors and certain\n\n\nmembers of senior management in relation to the performance\n\n\nof the Board against a set of agreed criteria.\n\n\nOnce an externally facilitated review occurs, the progress\n\n\nagainst any recommendations from the most recent externally\n\n\nfacilitated review, together with any new issues, will be\n\n\nconsidered internally. Feedback from each director against a\n\n\nset of agreed criteria will be collected by the Chairman or the\n\n\nexternal facilitator. The CEC and CEO will also provide feedback\n\n\nfrom senior executives in connection with any issues that may\n\n\nbe relevant in the context of the Board performance review.\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\nFeedback will be collected by the Chairman, or an external\n\n\nfacilitator, and discussed by the Board, with consideration\n\n\nbeing given as to whether any steps should be taken to improve\n\n\nperformance of the Board or its committees.\n\n\nSince the adoption of the Protocol in 2012, the Company carried\n\n\nout three annual board performance reviews internally, and has\n\n\nconducted one externally facilitated board performance review.\n\n\nAn externally facilitated review of the Board was carried out in\n\n\n2016 (in respect of 2015) and a review of the Board was conducted\n\n\ninternally in 2017 (in respect of 2016), in accordance with process\n\n\ndisclosed above.\n\n\nThe Nomination and Remuneration Committee considered\n\n\nassessments by a number of independent bodies regarding\n\n\nBoards of Australian companies and their performance. The chair\n\n\nof the Nomination and Remuneration Committee reported any\n\n\nmaterial issues or findings from these evaluations to the Board.\n\n\nBoard committees\n\n\nEach of the four standing committees of the Board conducts\n\n\nan annual committee performance self-assessment to review\n\n\nperformance using guidelines approved by the Nomination and\n\n\nRemuneration Committee.

The CEO’s performance is\n\n\nassessed against qualitative and quantitative criteria, including\n\n\nprofit performance, other financial measures, safety performance\n\n\nand strategic actions. The Nomination and Remuneration\n\n\nCommittee also undertakes an annual formal review of the\n\n\nperformance of other members of the Executive Committee,\n\n\nbased on similar criteria. The Board reviews and approves the\n\n\nannual review of all the members of the Executive Committee\n\n\nundertaken by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.\n\n\nThe performance evaluation for the CEC, CEO and\n\n\nsenior executives took place in 2016 in accordance with\n\n\nthe process disclosed above and in the Remuneration Report.\n\n\nThe results of the performance review are disclosed in the\n\n\nRemuneration Report.\n\n\n73\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\n_Corporate Governance Statement_\n\n\n**Principle 2: Structure the Board to add value**\n\n\nStructure of the board\n\n\nCurrently, the Board comprises Xiyong Li, Cunliang Lai, Baocai\n\n\nZhang, Yuxiang Wu, Boyun Xu, William Randall, Geoffrey Raby,\n\n\nGregory Fletcher, Vincent O’Rourke AM, Huaqiao Zhang and\n\n\nFuqi Wang.\n\n\nThe skills, experience and expertise of each director and the\n\n\nperiod that each director has held office is disclosed in the\n\n\nInformation on directors in the Directors’ Report, on page 49.\n\n\nThe Constitution provides that there will be a minimum\n\n\nof four and a maximum of 11 directors of the Company,\n\n\nunless the Company resolves otherwise at a general meeting.\n\n\nChairman of the board\n\n\nThe current Chairman, Xiyong Li, was nominated by the\n\n\nCompany’s major shareholder, Yanzhou.

The Company’s\n\n\nindependent directors are Vincent O’Rourke AM, Geoffrey Raby,\n\n\nGregory Fletcher, William Randall and Huaqiao Zhang.\n\n\nThe Board has assessed the independence of each of the\n\n\nNon-Executive Directors (including the Chairman) in light of\n\n\ntheir interests and relationships. A majority of the Board are\n\n\nnot considered independent directors having regard to their\n\n\naffiliation with the Company’s major shareholder, Yanzhou, and\n\n\naccordingly the Company does not comply with Recommendation\n\n\n2.4 of the ASX Recommendation. However, the Board considers\n\n\nthat its composition appropriately represents the interests of its\n\n\nshareholders including its major shareholder, Yanzhou, and that\n\n\nthe Board has put in place appropriate policies and procedures\n\n\nto guide the Board and senior executives in circumstances where\n\n\nconflicts of interest may arise in its dealings with Yanzhou,\n\n\nincluding establishing the Independent Board Committee\n\n\nreferred to above.\n\n\nTo help ensure that any conflicts of interests are identified,\n\n\nthe Company has put in place a standing agenda item at all\n\n\nmeetings of the Board and its committees to provide the\n\n\ndirectors with the opportunity of declaring any conflicts\n\n\nof interests in the subject matter of the proposed resolutions\n\n\nmade within the meeting.\n\n\nTo assist the Board in making independent judgements,\n\n\nthe Board Charter sets out the procedure by which the Board\n\n\ncollectively, and each individual director, can seek independent\n\n\nprofessional advice, at the Company’s expense.\n\n\nEach independent director must regularly provide the Board with\n\n\nall information relevant to their continued compliance with the\n\n\nindependence standard. The independence of directors will be\n\n\nreviewed by the Board on a regular basis with assistance from the\n\n\nNomination and Remuneration Committee. The Nomination and\n\n\nRemuneration Committee will also assist the Board with regular\n\n\nevaluation of the performance of the Board, Board committees\n\n\nand individual directors.\n\n\n76\n\n\n\nIndependence standard\n\n\nIn assessing the independence of its directors, the Board has\n\n\nregard to the factors relevant to assessing the independence\n\n\nof a director that are set out in Box 2.3 of the ASX\n\n\nRecommendations (3rd edition). The criteria considered\n\n\nin assessing the independence of Non-Executive Directors\n\n\nare also set out in the Board Charter.\n\n\nA director is considered independent if the director:\n\n\n- Is not, and has not within the last three years been,\n\n\nemployed in an executive capacity by the Company\n\n\nor any of its child entities;\n\n\n- Is not, nor has within the last three years been, a partner,\n\n\ndirector or senior employee of a provider of material\n\n\nprofessional services to the Company or any of its child entities;\n\n\n- Is not, nor has within the last three years been, in a material\n\n\nbusiness relationship with the Company or any of its child\n\n\nentities, or an officer of, or otherwise associated with, someone\n\n\nwith such a relationship;\n\n\n- Is not a substantial Shareholder of the Company or an officer\n\n\nof, or otherwise associated with, a substantial Shareholder\n\n\nof the Company;\n\n\n- Does not have a material contractual relationship with the\n\n\nCompany or any of its child entities other than as a director;\n\n\n- Does not have close family ties with any person who falls\n\n\nwithin any of the categories described above;\n\n\n- Has not been a director of the Company for such a period that\n\n\nhis or her independence may have been compromised; and\n\n\n- Is free from any other interest, position, association or\n\n\nrelationship that might interfere, or might reasonably be\n\n\nseen to interfere, with the director’s capacity to bring an\n\n\nindependent judgement to bear on issues before the Board\n\n\nand to act in the best interests of the Company and its\n\n\nshareholders generally.\n\n\nThe Company’s Constitution provides that the Company’s\n\n\nshareholders holding a majority of the issued shares of the\n\n\nCompany (which confer the right to vote) may nominate\n\n\na director to the office of Chairman and may elect one\n\n\nor more directors to the office of Vice Chair.\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\nAlthough as a nominee of Yanzhou, Xiyong Li, the Chairman\n\n\nis not considered independent by the independence standard\n\n\n(as above), the Board considers that this is an appropriate\n\n\nreflection of Yanzhou’s majority shareholding in the Company.\n\n\nWhile a majority of the directors are associated with Yanzhou,\n\n\nthis is considered appropriate in light of Yanzhou’s major\n\n\nshareholding in the Company.\n\n\nWilliam Randall is an executive director of Noble Group\n\n\nLimited (a substantial shareholder and material customer\n\n\nof the Company). The Board considers that this relationship\n\n\ndoes not materially interfere with, nor is perceived to interfere\n\n\nwith, the independent exercise of Mr Randall’s judgement\n\n\nand that he is able to fulfil the role of independent director\n\n\nfor the purpose of the ASX Recommendations. Accordingly,\n\n\nwhilst Mr Randall has a relationship with the Company\n\n\nwhich falls within the items listed in Box 2.3 of the ASX\n\n\nRecommendations, the Board considers William Randall to be\n\n\nan independent Non-Executive Director. Where appropriate,\n\n\nMr Randall stands aside from decision making where conflicts\n\n\nof interest may arise, and in those circumstances does not\n\n\nparticipate in Independent Board Committees.\n\n\nBoard skills matrix\n\n\nThe table below sets out the skills and experience\n\n\nthat are currently represented on the Board.\n\n\n**Skills and Experiences** **Total**\n\n\nMining/Exploration and production 5\n\n\nEngineering 4\n\n\nCapital projects 8\n\n\nTrading/Marketing 5\n\n\nStrategy 11\n\n\nLeadership 10\n\n\nBoard/Committee experience 10\n\n\nCorporate governance 7\n\n\nAccounting/Audit/Risk management 6\n\n\nGovernment/Policy 8\n\n\nLegal/Regulatory 5\n\n\nHealth, safety and environment 7\n\n\nHuman resources 5\n\n\nInternational business expertise 10\n\n\n\nInduction and professional development\n\n\nUpon appointment, directors are provided with an information\n\n\npack containing a letter of appointment setting out the Company’s\n\n\nexpectations, directors’ duties and the terms and conditions\n\n\nof their appointment, and other materials containing information\n\n\nabout the Company including the Company’s Constitution,\n\n\ncharters and policies to support the induction of directors\n\n\nto the Board.\n\n\nDirectors also participate in continuing education\n\n\nor development programs arranged for them, including,\n\n\nfor example, training on director’s duties and developments\n\n\nin workplace health and safety law.\n\n\nThe Company Secretary supports directors by providing access\n\n\nto information in appropriate form where requested.\n\n\n**Principle 3: Act ethically and responsibly**\nConduct and ethics\n\n\nThe Board policy is that directors, employees and contractors\n\n\nmust observe both the letter and spirit of the law, and adhere\n\n\nto the highest standards of business conduct.

The external auditor\n\n\nalso attends the Company’s Annual General Meeting to answer\n\n\nquestions from shareholders relevant to the Company’s audit.\n\n\n**Principle 5: Make timely and balanced disclosure**\n\n\nThe Company recognises the importance of timely and adequate\n\n\ndisclosure to the market, and is committed to making timely\n\n\nand balanced disclosure of all material matters and to effective\n\n\ncommunication with its shareholders and investors so as to give\n\n\nthem ready access to balanced and understandable information.\n\n\nThe Company also works together with its major shareholder,\n\n\nYanzhou, to ensure that Yanzhou can comply with its disclosure\n\n\nobligations in relation to Company information, and vice versa,\n\n\nYanzhou seeks to ensure that the Company can comply with its\n\n\ndisclosure obligations in relation to Yanzhou’s information.\n\n\nConsistent with their charters, the Audit and Risk Management\n\n\nCommittee, Nomination and Remuneration Committee and\n\n\nExecutive Committee review, to the extent reasonably practicable,\n\n\nall public disclosures and statements concerning matters relevant\n\n\nto their duties and responsibilities including disclosures in the\n\n\nCompany’s annual report and certain ASX disclosures.\n\n\nThe Board has put in place a Disclosure Policy to encapsulate\n\n\nthe disclosure obligations under the _Corporations Act 2001_\n\n\nand the ASX Listing Rules and to set out procedures for\n\n\nmanaging compliance with those obligations. These procedures\n\n\nprovide a framework for managing the disclosure of material\n\n\nmatters to the market to ensure accountability at Board and senior\n\n\nexecutive level. As part of this framework, a standing agenda item\n\n\nat all the Company’s Board and Executive Committee meetings\n\n\nrequires the directors and senior executive to consider whether\n\n\nany matters at the meeting should be disclosed to the market.\n\n\nThe Disclosure Policy can be found within the Corporate\n\n\nGovernance section of the Company’s website.\n\n\n\nA Disclosure Committee has been established to assist the\n\n\nCompany to meet its disclosure obligations. The Committee\n\n\nplays a key role in reviewing and determining whether\n\n\ninformation is likely to have material effect on the price or value\n\n\nof the Company’s securities such that it requires disclosure to\n\n\nthe market. The Disclosure Committee members comprise the\n\n\nCEC, CEO, CFO, Company Secretary, Investor Relations General\n\n\nManager and Group Counsel. Any information disclosed to the\n\n\nmarket through an announcement to the ASX is also published\n\n\non the Investor section of the Company’s website.\n\n\n**Principle 6: Respect the rights of shareholders**\n\n\nCommunications with shareholders\n\n\nThe Company has an investor relations program that\n\n\nis aimed at facilitating two-way communications with investors.\n\n\nThe Company’s policy is to promote effective communication\n\n\nwith shareholders and other investors so that they understand\n\n\nhow to assess relevant information about the Company and its\n\n\ncorporate direction. The Company aims to keep shareholders,\n\n\npotential investors and other stakeholders informed of all major\n\n\ndevelopments affecting the state of affairs of the Company.\n\n\nThe Company communicates information regularly to\n\n\nshareholders, potential investors and other stakeholders by:\n\n\n- Posting announcements on the ASX platform in accordance\n\n\nwith its continuous disclosure obligations and also making\n\n\nthese announcements available on the Company’s website;\n\n\n- Keeping its website up to date on important information about\n\n\nthe Company, including its Constitution, Board and Board\n\n\nCommittee Charters, core corporate governance policies and\n\n\nfinancial information about the Company; and\n\n\n- Publishing investor presentations made to analysts\n\n\nand media briefings available within the Investor section\n\n\nof the Company’s website.\n\n\nThe Company encourages shareholders to attend and participate\n\n\nin all general meetings including annual general meetings.\n\n\nShareholders are entitled to ask questions about the management\n\n\nof the Company and of the auditor as to its conduct of the audit\n\n\nand preparation of its reports. Any shareholders who cannot\n\n\nattend any general meetings can also participate via lodgement\n\n\nof their proxies.

Operational difficulties may impact\n\n\nthe amount of coal produced, delay coal deliveries or increase\n\n\nthe cost of mining for a varying length of time. These operating\n\n\nrisks include (but are not limited to) industrial, mine collapses,\n\n\ncave-ins or other failures relating to mine infrastructure,\n\n\nincluding tailings dams, interruptions due to inclement or\n\n\nhazardous weather conditions, power interruption, critical\n\n\nequipment failure (in particular any protracted breakdown or\n\n\nissues with any of the Company’s CHPP or a major excavator),\n\n\nfires, and explosions from methane gas or coal dust, accidental\n\n\nmine water discharges, flooding and variations in or unusual\n\n\nor unexpected geological or geotechnical mining conditions\n\n\n(particularly in the Company’s underground operations). Such\n\n\nrisks could result in damage to applicable mines, personal injury,\n\n\nenvironmental damage, delays in coal production, decreased\n\n\ncoal production, loss of revenue, monetary losses and possible\n\n\nlegal liability. Although the Company’s insurance policies provide\n\n\ncoverage for some of these risks, the amount and scope of\n\n\ninsurance cover is limited by market and economic factors\n\n\nand there can be no assurance that these risks would be fully\n\n\ncovered by insurances maintained by the Company.\n\n\nInjury or accident risks\n\n\nIf any injuries or accidents occur in a mine, this could have\n\n\nadverse financial implications including legal claims for personal\n\n\ninjury, wrongful death, amendments to approvals, potential\n\n\nproduction delays or stoppages, any of which may have a material\n\n\nadverse effect on the financial performance and/or financial\n\n\nposition of the Company.\n\n\nFunding risks\n\n\nThe amount of future funding required by the Company will\n\n\ndepend on a number of factors, including the performance of\n\n\nthe Company’s business at that time. The Company’s business\n\n\noperations and cash flow are highly sensitive to any fluctuation in\n\n\nthe US$ coal price, coal production from its operations, demand\n\n\nfor its coal product and US$ movement in foreign exchange rates,\n\n\nparticularly movements in the A$:US$ exchange rate.\n\n\n82\n\n\n\nIn developing its business plan and operating budget, the\n\n\nCompany has made certain assumptions regarding coal prices,\n\n\nthe A$:US$ exchange rate, future production levels and other\n\n\nfactors which determine the Company’s financial performance.\n\n\nIf a funding shortfall materialises, the Company may need to raise\n\n\nsubstantial additional debt or equity. The Company’s capacity to\n\n\nsecure the requisite level of funding will depend on the amount\n\n\nof funding required, the performance and future prospects of its\n\n\nbusiness and a number of other factors, including US$ coal prices,\n\n\ninterest rates, economic conditions, debt market conditions,\n\n\nequity market conditions, and future levels of Yanzhou support.\n\n\nTo the extent that the Company is not able to secure additional\n\n\nfinancing (whether debt or equity) on acceptable terms from third\n\n\nparties, the Company will continue to rely on financial support\n\n\nfrom Yanzhou.\n\n\nAdverse foreign exchange rate movements\n\n\nForeign exchange risk is the risk of the Company sustaining\n\n\nloss through adverse movements in exchange rates. Such losses\n\n\ncan impact the Company’s financial position and performance\n\n\nand the level of additional funding required to support the\n\n\nCompany’s businesses.\n\n\nThe liabilities, earnings and cash flows of the Company\n\n\nare influenced by movements in exchange rates, especially\n\n\nmovements in the A$:US$ exchange rate.\n\n\nForeign currency exposure arises particularly in relation to coal\n\n\nsupply contracts, which generally are priced and payable in US$,\n\n\nprocurement of imported plant and equipment, which can be\n\n\npriced in US$ or other foreign currencies, and debt denominated\n\n\nin currencies other than A$.\n\n\nThe impact of exchange rate movements will vary depending\n\n\non factors such as the nature, magnitude and duration of the\n\n\nmovements, the extent to which currency risk is hedged under\n\n\nforward exchange contracts and the terms of these contracts.\n\n\nThe Company has put in place accounting hedges, pursuant\n\n\nto Australian Accounting Standard 139, where future US$\n\n\ndenominated loan repayments are designated as “natural cash\n\n\nflow hedges” of future US$ denominated coal sales revenues in\n\n\nthe periods immediately prior to each committed debt repayment.\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\nCoal prices and coal demand risks\n\n\nThe Company generates revenue from the sale of coal.\n\n\nIn developing its business plan and operating budget, the\n\n\nCompany makes certain assumptions regarding coal prices\n\n\nand demand for coal. The prices which the Company will receive\n\n\nfor its coal depend on numerous market factors beyond its control\n\n\nand, accordingly, some underlying coal price assumptions relied\n\n\non by the Company may materially change and actual coal prices\n\n\nand demand may differ materially from those expected.\n\n\nThe prices for coal are determined predominantly by world\n\n\nmarkets, which are affected by numerous factors, including the\n\n\noutcome of future sale contract negotiations, general economic\n\n\nactivity, industrial production levels, changes in foreign exchange\n\n\nrates, changes in energy demand and demand for steel, changes\n\n\nin the supply of seaborne coal, technological changes, changes\n\n\nin production levels and events interfering with supply, changes\n\n\nin international freight rates or other transportation\n\n\ninfrastructure and costs, the costs of other commodities and\n\n\nsubstitutes for coal, market changes in coal quality requirements,\n\n\ngovernment regulations which restrict use of coal, and tax\n\n\nimpositions on the resources industry, all of which are outside\n\n\nthe control of the Company and may have a material adverse\n\n\nimpact on coal prices and demand.\n\n\nCoal production risks\n\n\nImprovement in the Company’s financial performance\n\n\nis dependent on the Company being able to sustain or increase\n\n\ncoal production and decrease operating costs on a per tonne\n\n\nbasis. The Company’s success or failure in improving productivity\n\n\nwill become particularly important to the Company’s financial\n\n\nperformance if the coal price remains at current levels\n\n\nor falls further.\n\n\nThe Company’s coal production can be impacted by a number\n\n\nof factors, including unforeseen geological or geotechnical\n\n\nissues (particularly in the Company’s underground operations),\n\n\nabnormal wet weather conditions (particularly in Queensland),\n\n\nunforeseen delays or complexities in installing and operating\n\n\nmining longwall systems, protracted breakdown of coal handling\n\n\ninfrastructure and other mining equipment and rail and port\n\n\nbreakdowns and outages. Regulatory factors and the occurrence\n\n\nof other operating risks can also limit production.\n\n\n\nRegulatory approvals risks\n\n\nThe ability of the Company to meet its long term production\n\n\ntarget profile depends on (amongst other things) the Company\n\n\nbeing able to obtain on a timely basis, and maintain, all\n\n\nnecessary regulatory approvals (including any approvals\n\n\narising under applicable mining laws, environmental\n\n\nregulations and other laws) for its current operations and\n\n\nexpansion and growth projects, including obtaining planning\n\n\napprovals, land access, land owner consents and addressing\n\n\nany native title issues, impacts on the environment and\n\n\nobjections from local communities.\n\n\nThere is no assurance or guarantee that the Company will\n\n\nbe in a position to secure any or all of the required consents,\n\n\napprovals and rights necessary to maintain its current production\n\n\nprofile from its existing operations or to develop its growth\n\n\nprojects in a manner which will result in profitable mining\n\n\noperations and the achievement of its long term production\n\n\ntargets. If these approvals (or other approvals required for the\n\n\nplanned production increases) are not obtained, or if conditional\n\n\nor limited approvals are obtained, the economic viability of the\n\n\nrelevant projects may be adversely affected, which may in turn\n\n\nresult in the value of the relevant assets being impaired.\n\n\nThe Company continues to engage openly and transparently\n\n\nwith all State and federal Government and approval bodies,\n\n\nwhile operating to the highest safety, environmental and\n\n\nlegislative standards to work towards facilitating all approvals\n\n\nas required.\n\n\nEstimates of Resources and Reserves and geology\n\n\nThe volume and quality of the coal that the Company recovers\n\n\nmay be less than the Resource and Reserve estimates reported to\n\n\ndate. Resource and Reserve estimates are expressions of judgment\n\n\nbased on knowledge, experience and industry practice. There are\n\n\nrisks associated with such estimates, including that coal mined\n\n\nmay be of a different quality or grade, tonnage or strip ratio from\n\n\nthose in the estimates and the ability to economically extract\n\n\nand process the coal may not eventuate. Resource and Reserve\n\n\nestimates are necessarily imprecise and depend to some extent\n\n\non interpretations and geological assumptions, coal prices, cost\n\n\nassumptions, and statistical inferences which may ultimately\n\n\nprove to have been unreliable.\n\n\n83\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\n_Corporate Governance Statement_\n\n\nResource and Reserve estimates are regularly revised based\n\n\non actual production experience or new information and could\n\n\ntherefore be expected to change. Furthermore, should the\n\n\nCompany encounter mineralisation or formations different\n\n\nfrom those predicted by past drilling, sampling and similar\n\n\nexaminations, Resource and Reserve estimates may have to be\n\n\nadjusted and mining plans, coal processing and infrastructure\n\n\nmay have to be altered in a way that might adversely affect their\n\n\noperations. If it is determined that mining of certain Reserves\n\n\nare uneconomic, this may lead to a reduction in the Company’s\n\n\naggregate Reserve estimates.\n\n\nIf the Company’s actual Resource and Reserve estimates are less\n\n\nthan current estimates, the Company’s prospects, value, business,\n\n\nresults of operations and financial condition may be materially\n\n\nadversely affected.\n\n\nTake-or-pay liabilities\n\n\nPort and rail (above rail and below rail) capacity is generally\n\n\ncontracted via long-term take-or-pay contracts. The Company will\n\n\ngenerally be required to pay for its contracted rail or port tonnage\n\n\nirrespective of whether it is utilised. Unused port or rail capacity\n\n\ncan arise as a result of circumstances including insufficient\n\n\nproduction from a given mine, a mismatch between port and rail\n\n\ncapacity for a mine, or an inability to transfer the used capacity\n\n\ndue to contractual limitations such as required consent of the\n\n\nprovider of the port or rail services, or because the coal must\n\n\nemanate from specified source mines or be loaded onto trains\n\n\nat specified load points.\n\n\nMine closure\n\n\nClosure of any of the mines or other operations of the Company\n\n\nbefore the end of their mine life (e.g. due to environmental and\n\n\n/or health and safety issues), could trigger significant employee\n\n\nredundancy costs, closure and rehabilitation expense and other\n\n\ncosts or loss of revenues. Many of these costs will also be incurred\n\n\nwhere mines are closed at the end of their planned mine life or\n\n\nplaced on care and maintenance. A move to care and maintenance\n\n\nhas the potential to trigger significant employee redundancy\n\n\ncosts and a subsequent loss of revenues, as a minimal employee\n\n\npresence is required for ongoing management and rehabilitation\n\n\nof the mine.\n\n\n84\n\n\n\nIf one or more of the relevant sites are closed earlier than\n\n\nanticipated, the Company will be required to fund the closure\n\n\ncosts on an expedited basis and potentially lose revenues, which\n\n\ncould have an adverse financial effect. In addition, there is a risk\n\n\nthat claims may be made arising from environmental remediation\n\n\nupon closure of one or more of their sites.\n\n\nCoal supply agreements\n\n\nThe Company’s coal supply agreements typically require the\n\n\ndelivery of a fixed or minimum quantity of coal at a location, at\n\n\na time and over a period stipulated in the agreement. To the extent\n\n\nthat any contracted volumes cannot be delivered as agreed, the\n\n\nCompany may be liable to pay substantial compensation for the\n\n\nresulting losses, costs and charges (including demurrage) incurred\n\n\nby the buyer.\n\n\nAs customer contracts expire, the Company’s financial\n\n\nperformance may be adversely affected if it is unable to renew\n\n\nthose contracts or enter into replacement contracts on no less\n\n\nfavourable terms.\n\n\nIt is possible that the coal quality specifications required by\n\n\ncustomers and the market more broadly may evolve over time\n\n\nto meet import restrictions and other regulatory requirements,\n\n\ntechnology advancements and other factors. If the Company is\n\n\nunable to supply coal that meets those specifications, its financial\n\n\nperformance may be adversely affected.\n\n\nJoint ventures and reliance on third parties\n\n\nThe Company holds a number of joint venture interests,\n\n\nincluding interests in the Middlemount and Moolarben mines,\n\n\nPWCS, NCIG and WICET, with other parties. Decision making,\n\n\nmanagement, marketing and other key aspects of each joint\n\n\nventure are regulated by agreements between the relevant\n\n\njoint venture participants.\n\n\nThe Company cannot control the actions of third party joint\n\n\nventure participants, and therefore cannot guarantee that joint\n\n\nventures will be operated or managed in accordance with the\n\n\npreferred direction or strategy of the Company. There is a risk\n\n\nthat the veto rights of, or consents required from, the joint venture\n\n\npartners will prevent the business and assets of a joint venture\n\n\nfrom being developed, operated and managed in accordance\n\n\nwith that preferred direction or strategy.\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\nThe Company also use contractors and other third parties\n\n\nfor exploration, mining and other services generally, and\n\n\nis reliant on a number of third parties for the success of its\n\n\ncurrent operations and for the development of its growth\n\n\nprojects. While this is normal for the mining and exploration\n\n\nindustry, problems caused by third parties may arise which\n\n\nmay have an impact on the performance and operations\n\n\nof the Company. Any failure by counterparties to perform\n\n\ntheir obligations may have a material adverse effect on the\n\n\nCompany and there can be no assurance that the Company\n\n\nwill be successful in attempting to enforce its contractual\n\n\nrights through legal action.\n\n\nTitle risks\n\n\nExploring or mining for coal is generally illegal without a\n\n\ntenement granted by the State Governments. The grant and\n\n\nrenewal of tenements is subject to a regulatory regime and each\n\n\ntenement is subject to certain conditions. There is no certainty\n\n\nthat an application for grant or renewal of a tenement will\n\n\nbe granted at all or on satisfactory terms or within expected\n\n\ntimeframes. Further, the conditions attached to tenements may\n\n\nchange. The permitting rules are complex and may change over\n\n\ntime, making the title holder’s responsibility to comply with\n\n\nthe applicable requirements more onerous, more costly or even\n\n\nimpossible, thereby precluding or impairing continuing or future\n\n\nmining operations. There is a risk that the Company may lose title\n\n\nto any of its granted titles if it is unable to comply with conditions\n\n\nor if the land subject to the title is required for public purposes.\n\n\nThere is also a risk that a tenement may not be granted from any\n\n\napplications for renewals of tenements or for new tenements.\n\n\nOverlapping tenement risks\n\n\nSome of the Company’s mines and associated tenements adjoin\n\n\nor are overlapped by petroleum tenements and adjoin other\n\n\nexploration interests held by third parties. Overlapping tenements\n\n\ncould potentially prevent, delay or increase the cost of the future\n\n\ndevelopment of the Company’s projects because the Company and\n\n\nthe relevant petroleum exploration licence or other exploration\n\n\nlicence holders could potentially seek to undertake their\n\n\nrespective activities on the overlapping area or the same resource\n\n\nseams and in some cases the overlapping petroleum tenure\n\n\nholder’s consent may be required.\n\n\n\nEnforcement and counterparty insolvency risks\n\n\nThe Company has entered into contracts which are important\n\n\nto the future of its businesses including (but not limited to) for\n\n\nthe provision of coal handling services, long term sales contracts,\n\n\ndebt facilities, long term leases, contract mining and the provision\n\n\nof certain guarantees, indemnities and sureties.\n\n\nAny failure by counterparties to perform those contracts may\n\n\nhave a material adverse effect on the Company and there can\n\n\nbe no assurance that it would be successful in enforcing any\n\n\nof its contractual rights through legal action.\n\n\nIn addition, any insolvency of a counterparty to any of these\n\n\ncontracts may have a material adverse effect on the Company\n\n\nand there can be no assurance that it would be successful in\n\n\nenforcing any of its contractual rights through legal action or\n\n\nrecovering all monies owned by that counterparty (including\n\n\nunder any claim for damages).\n\n\nChanges in government policy, regulation or legislation\n\n\nThe resources industry is subject to extensive legislation,\n\n\nregulations and supervision by a number of federal and state\n\n\nregulatory organisations.\n\n\nAny future legislation and regulatory change may affect the\n\n\nresources industry and may adversely affect the Company’s\n\n\nfinancial performance and position, such as future laws that\n\n\nmay limit the emission of greenhouse gases or the use of coal\n\n\nin power generation.\n\n\nLitigation\n\n\nLike all companies in the resources sector, the Company is\n\n\nexposed to the risks of litigation (either as the complainant or\n\n\nas the defendant), which may have a material adverse effect on\n\n\nthe financial position of the relevant entity. The Company could\n\n\nbecome exposed to claims or litigation by persons alleging they\n\n\nare owed fees for services, employees, regulators, competitors\n\n\nor other third parties.\n\n\nExploration and development risks\n\n\nThere are several risks relating to coal mining exploration and\n\n\ndevelopment which are common to the industry and which,\n\n\nif realised, have the capacity to affect operations, production,\n\n\ncash flow and financial performance of the Company.\n\n\n85\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\n_Corporate Governance Statement_\n\n\nDevelopment and exploration activities may be affected by\n\n\nfactors beyond the control of the Company, including geological\n\n\nconditions, seismic activity, mineralisation, consistency and\n\n\npredictability of coal grades, changes to law, changes to the\n\n\nregulatory framework applying to mining, overlapping resources\n\n\ntenure, and the rights of indigenous people on whose land\n\n\nexploration activities are undertaken.\n\n\nAny discovery of a mineral deposit does not guarantee that the\n\n\nmining of that deposit would be commercially viable, with the size\n\n\nof the deposit, development and operating costs, land ownership,\n\n\ncoal prices and recovery rates all being key factors in determining\n\n\ncommercial viability.\n\n\nTransport and infrastructure\n\n\nCoal produced from the Company’s mining operations is\n\n\ntransported to customers by a combination of road, rail and sea.\n\n\nA number of factors could disrupt or restrict access to essential\n\n\ncoal transportation and handling services, including (but not\n\n\nlimited to):\n\n\n- Weather related problems;\n\n\n- Key equipment and infrastructure failures;\n\n\n- Rail or port capacity constraints;\n\n\n- Congestions and inter-system losses;\n\n\n- Industrial action;\n\n\n- Failure to obtain consents from third parties for access\n\n\nto rail or land;\n\n\n- Failure or delay in the construction of new rail or port capacity;\n\n\n- Failure to meet contractual requirements;\n\n\n- Access is removed or not granted by regulatory authority;\n\n\n- Breach of regulatory framework; and\n\n\n- Mismatch of below rail capacity, above rail capacity\n\n\nand port capacity.\n\n\nAll or any of which could impair the Company’s ability\n\n\nto supply coal to customers and/or increase costs,\n\n\nand consequently may have a material adverse effect\n\n\non the Company’s financial position.\n\n\n86\n\n\n\nEnvironmental risks\n\n\nDue to the nature of coal mining processes, and the associated\n\n\nby-products, residues and tailings generated from these\n\n\nprocesses, all operations of the Company are subject to stringent\n\n\nenvironmental laws and regulations.\n\n\nThere is a risk that past, present or future operations have\n\n\nnot met or will not meet environmental or related regulatory\n\n\nrequirements and/or that the approvals or modifications the\n\n\nCompany is currently seeking, or may need to seek in the future,\n\n\nwill not be granted. If the Company is unsuccessful in these\n\n\nefforts or otherwise breaches these environmental requirements,\n\n\nit may incur fines or penalties, be required to curtail or cease\n\n\noperations and/or be subject to increased compliance costs or\n\n\ncosts for rehabilitation or rectification works, which have not been\n\n\npreviously planned at one or more of its sites.\n\n\nEnvironmental legislation may change in a manner that may\n\n\nrequire compliance with additional standards, and a heightened\n\n\ndegree of responsibility for companies and their directors\n\n\nand employees. There may also be unforeseen environmental\n\n\nliabilities resulting from coal related activities, which may be\n\n\ncostly to remedy. In particular, the acceptable level of pollution\n\n\nand the potential abandonment costs and obligations for which\n\n\nthe Company may become liable as a result of its activities may\n\n\nbe impossible to assess under the current legal framework.\n\n\nHealth, safety and hazardous materials risks\n\n\nThe Company‘s operations may substantially impact the\n\n\nenvironment or cause exposure to hazardous materials. It will\n\n\nuse hazardous materials and will generate hazardous waste, and\n\n\nmay be subject to common law claims, damages due to natural\n\n\ndisasters, and other damages, as well as the investigation and\n\n\nclean-up of soil, surface water, groundwater, and other media.\n\n\nSuch claims may arise, for example, out of current or former\n\n\nactivities at sites that it owns or operates.\n\n\nThere is also a risk that actions could be brought against\n\n\nthe Company, alleging adverse effects of such substances\n\n\non personal health.\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\nThere is a risk that past, present or future operations have not\n\n\nmet, or will not meet, health and safety requirements and/or that\n\n\nthe approvals or modifications the Company is currently seeking,\n\n\nor may need to seek in the future, will not be granted at all or on\n\n\nterms that are unduly onerous. If the Company is unsuccessful\n\n\nin these efforts or otherwise breaches these health and safety\n\n\nrequirements, it may incur fines or penalties, be required\n\n\nto curtail or cease operations and/or be subject to increased\n\n\ncompliance costs or costs for rehabilitation or rectification works,\n\n\nwhich have not been previously planned at one or more of its sites.\n\n\nImpairment risks\n\n\nEffective on and from 31 March 2016 (“Completion Date”), the\n\n\nCompany put in place a new financial arrangement, by executing\n\n\na Bond Subscription Agreement and other relevant or incidental\n\n\nagreements (“Watagan Agreements”). In general, the Company\n\n\nhas secured up to US$950 million in new debt funding via the\n\n\nissue of nine-year secured debt bonds by a newly established\n\n\nsubsidiary of the Company, Watagan Mining Company Pty Ltd\n\n\n(“Watagan”), to Industrial Bank Co., Ltd, BOCI Asia Financial\n\n\nProducts Limited and United NSW Energy (“UNE”).\n\n\nIn accordance with the terms of the Watagan Agreement, the\n\n\nCompany’s interests in the New South Wales mining assets of\n\n\nAshton, Austar and Donaldson have been transferred to Watagan,\n\n\na majority of directors of which are nominated by UNE. As a\n\n\nconsequence, the Company ceased to control Watagan and its\n\n\nsubsidiaries from an accounting perspective, and the assets,\n\n\nliabilities and results of Watagan and its subsidiaries will not\n\n\nbe incorporated into the Company’s consolidated financial\n\n\nstatements from the Completion date.\n\n\nAt the end of the term of the Bond Subscription Agreement,\n\n\nwhich is scheduled for in 2025, (or earlier if control over Watagan\n\n\nis determined to pass back to the Company), the Company would\n\n\nreconsolidate Watagan’s results and financial position for the\n\n\npoint that control is regained, and this re-acquisition would be\n\n\ntreated as a business combination. Additionally, the Bondholders\n\n\nhave a put option that allows them to put the issued debt bonds to\n\n\nYankuang at approximately years three, five, seven and nine of the\n\n\nbond term, or on an event of default after three years. Exercise of\n\n\nthis put option would also result in the Company regaining control\n\n\nof Watagan.\n\n\n\nAs of 31 December 2016, the Company has a loan receivable\n\n\nfrom Watagan of AUD$775 million (re-drawable up to\n\n\nAUD$1.36 billion) which is subject to impairment testing.\n\n\nThere is a guarantee provided by Yankuang Group Co., Ltd\n\n\n(being the ultimate parent entity of the Company) to indemnify\n\n\nthe Company for any amounts due and payable under the loan\n\n\nwhich are not paid by Watagan. However, it is noted that when\n\n\ncontrol over Watagan is regained, Watagan will be subject to\n\n\nbusiness combination accounting that will require the Company\n\n\nto fair value the assets and liabilities being acquired from\n\n\nWatagan at that time and, could result in a deficit to the value\n\n\nof the loan being recognised as a financial loss.\n\n\nInternal audit function\n\n\nThe internal audit function is managed by the Executive\n\n\nGeneral Manager (EGM) of Risk Management and Auditing.\n\n\nThat person has direct access to the chair of the Audit and Risk\n\n\nManagement Committee, as well as to the CEC, to whom he\n\n\ndirectly reports. The Audit and Risk Management Committee\n\n\nrecommends to the Board the appointment of the EGM Risk\n\n\nManagement and Auditing.\n\n\nWhere appropriate the internal audit function is supported\n\n\nprimarily by external consultants.\n\n\nThe EGM of Risk Management and Auditing has unfettered\n\n\naccess to the Audit and Risk Management Committee and its\n\n\nchair to seek information and explanations. The chair of the Audit\n\n\nand Risk Management Committee meets independently with the\n\n\nEGM Risk Management and Auditing.\n\n\nThe role of the EGM Risk Management and Auditing includes\n\n\nachievement of the internal audit objectives, risk management\n\n\npolicies and insurance strategy.\n\n\nAn annual program for internal audit and risk assurance\n\n\nis provided to the Audit and Risk Management Committee\n\n\nfor approval. The annual Internal Audit program is focused\n\n\non key operating risks and processes design and effectiveness.\n\n\nThe program includes a review of compliance with the\n\n\nobligations imposed by the US Sarbanes Oxley Act (SOX),\n\n\nincluding evaluating and documenting internal controls as\n\n\nrequired by section 404 of SOX.\n\n\n87\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\n_Corporate Governance Statement_\n\n\nA status report on the execution of the plan, including\n\n\ncurrent findings and actions is provided to the Audit and\n\n\nRisk Management Committee at each quarterly meeting.\n\n\nAny material findings are reported to the Board.\n\n\nThe Audit and Risk Management Committee receives a report\n\n\non key issues and subsequently corrective actions are monitored,\n\n\nreviewed and reported.\n\n\nHealth, safety and environment compliance\n\n\nThe Company has adopted policies to comply with occupational\n\n\nhealth, safety, environment and other laws. The Board has\n\n\napproved a Health, Safety and Environment Policy which\n\n\napplies across the Company. In addition, each mine site\n\n\nhas its own health, safety and environmental policies\n\n\nand procedures to deal with their particular health, safety\n\n\nand environmental issues. The Board has established a Health,\n\n\nSafety and Environment Committee to assist it in overseeing\n\n\nthe Company’s health, safety and environmental responsibilities.\n\n\nIn accordance with its charter, this committee has at least three\n\n\nmembers. The members of this committee are Vincent O’Rourke\n\n\n(chair of the committee), Geoffrey Raby and Fuqi Wang.\n\n\nIt is intended the committee meets at least four times per year,\n\n\nor as frequently as required. The committee meetings are held\n\n\nat one of the Company’s mine sites, whenever possible, to receive\n\n\nfeedback from the health, safety and environment forum held at\n\n\nthe mine site and to address any mine specific health, safety and\n\n\nenvironment issues.\n\n\n88\n\n\n\n**Principle 8: Remunerate fairly and responsibly**\n\n\nNomination and Remuneration Committee\n\n\nThe Board has established a Nomination and Remuneration\n\n\nCommittee. In accordance with its Charter, this committee\n\n\ncurrently has three members, Xiyong Li (chair of the committee),\n\n\nCunliang Lai and William Randall. A majority of the committee\n\n\nand the chair of the committee is non-independent as Xiyong Li\n\n\nand Cunliang Lai are not independent directors of the Company.\n\n\nHowever, the Board considers them appropriate members, and\n\n\nin the case of Xiyong Li, an appropriate chair of this committee,\n\n\ndue to their skill set, experience and seniority, and that the\n\n\noverall composition of the Nomination and Remuneration\n\n\nCommittee is appropriate.\n\n\nThe committee members are Non-Executive Directors who are\n\n\nnot remunerated by the Company for their roles as directors or\n\n\ncommittee members. The purpose of the committee is outlined\n\n\nin the Board Committees section above.\n\n\nThe committee makes recommendations to the Board to achieve\n\n\nCompany remuneration structures that are equitable and aligned\n\n\nwith the long-term interests of the Company and its shareholders,\n\n\nto attract and retain skilled employees, to structure short and\n\n\nlong term incentives that are challenging and linked to creation\n\n\nof sustainable returns and to ensure any termination benefits\n\n\nare justifiable and appropriate.\n\n\nThe committee has the necessary power and resources to meet\n\n\nits responsibilities under its charter, including rights of access\n\n\nto management, auditors and external advisers. It is intended\n\n\nthat the committee will meet at least once per year, or as\n\n\nfrequently as required.\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\nRemuneration of Non-Executive Directors\n\n\nThe Constitution provides that the Non-Executive Directors\n\n\nare entitled to such remuneration as approved by the Company’s\n\n\nshareholders in accordance with the Constitution, which must\n\n\nnot exceed the aggregate annual amount as determined by the\n\n\nCompany in general meeting or by its major shareholder, Yanzhou.\n\n\nRemuneration for Non-Executive Directors is capped\n\n\nat an aggregate amount for each financial year of $3.5 million.\n\n\nNon-Executive Directors may also be paid such additional\n\n\nor special remuneration as the directors decide is appropriate\n\n\nwhere a Non-Executive Director performs extra services or makes\n\n\nspecial exertions for the benefit of the Company.\n\n\nSuch additional remuneration will not form part of the\n\n\ncalculation of the aggregate cap on Non-Executive Directors’\n\n\nremuneration for a financial year and do not require\n\n\nshareholder approval.\n\n\nFurther details of the remuneration of the Non-Executive\n\n\nDirectors, executive directors and senior executives can\n\n\nbe found in the Remuneration Report on page 56.\n\n\nThe Nomination and Remuneration Committee Charter\n\n\ncan be found within the Corporate Governance section\n\n\nof the Company’s website.\n\n\n\nDealings in company securities\n\n\nBy law, and under the Company’s Insider Trading Policy,\n\n\ndealing in Company securities is subject to the overriding\n\n\nprohibition on trading while in possession of inside information.\n\n\nIn addition, the Company’s Share Trading Policy prohibits dealing\n\n\nin Company securities or Yanzhou securities by directors, senior\n\n\nexecutives and other relevant employees, as well as their closely\n\n\nrelated parties, during specified blackout periods each year.\n\n\nGeneral employees are permitted to deal in Company securities\n\n\noutside these blackout periods, however additional approval\n\n\nrequirements apply to directors and the CEO.\n\n\nThe Share Trading Policy precludes relevant employees from\n\n\nentering into any hedge or derivative transactions relating\n\n\nto unvested options or share rights granted to them under\n\n\nincentive plans and securities that are subject to holding\n\n\nlocks or restrictions on dealing under such plans.\n\n\nThere are also restrictions that apply to relevant employees\n\n\nfrom entering into margin lending arrangements and short-term\n\n\ntrading of the Company’s securities.

resolution of the Directors on 28 February 2017.\n\n\n(i) Compliance with IFRS\n\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group\n\n\nalso comply with International Financial Reporting\n\n\nStandards(“IFRS”) as issued by the International\n\n\nAccounting Standards Board (“IASB”).\n\n\n(ii) Subsidiaries\n\n\nThe Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to,\n\n\nor has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with\n\n\nthe entity and has the ability to affect those returns through\n\n\nits power over the entity.\n\n\nSubsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which\n\n\ncontrol is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated\n\n\nfrom the date that control ceases.\n\n\nThe acquisition method of accounting is used to account for\n\n\nbusiness combinations by the Group. Intercompany transactions,\n\n\nbalances and unrealised gains on transactions between the\n\n\nGroup companies are eliminated.\n\n\nUnrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction\n\n\nprovides evidence of the impairment of the asset transferred.\n\n\nAccounting policies of subsidiaries are aligned to ensure\n\n\nconsistency with the policies adopted by the Group.\n\n\n94\n\n\n\n(iii) Significant accounting policies\n\n\nSignificant accounting policies have been included in the\n\n\nrelevant notes to which the policies relate, and other significant\n\n\naccounting policies are discussed in Note F5. These policies\n\n\nhave been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless\n\n\notherwise stated.\n\n\n(iv) Historical cost convention\n\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared on an accrual\n\n\nbasis and under the historical cost convention, as modified by\n\n\nthe revaluation of available for sale financial assets and financial\n\n\nassets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair\n\n\nvalue through profit or loss.\n\n\n(v) Rounding of amounts\n\n\nThe Company is of a kind referred to in ASIC Legislative\n\n\nInstrument 2016/191, issued by the Australian Securities\n\n\nand Investments Commission, relating to the ‘rounding off’\n\n\nof amounts in the financial statements.\n\n\nAmounts in the financial statements have been rounded off\n\n\nin accordance with that legislative instrument to the nearest\n\n\nhundred thousand dollars, or in certain cases, the nearest dollar.\n\n\n(vi) New and amended standards adopted by the Group\n\n\nIn the prior year, the Company elected to early adopt\n\n\nthe AASB 2014-3 Amendments to Australian Accounting\n\n\nStandards—Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests\n\n\nin Joint Operations (AASB 1 and AASB 11), and AASB\n\n\n2015-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting\n\n\nStandards—Disclosure Initiative.\n\n\nThe Group has not elected to apply any other pronouncements\n\n\nbefore their operative date in the annual reporting period\n\n\nbeginning 1 January 2016.\n\n\nYancoal Australia Ltd has not been required to change\n\n\nsome of its accounting policies as the result of new\n\n\nor revised accounting standards which became effective\n\n\nfor the annual reporting period commencing on 1 January\n\n\n2016. These standards are discussed in Note F6.\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\n(vii) Impact of standards issued but not yet applied by the group\n\n\nAustralian Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued but\n\n\nnot yet applicable for the year ended 31 December 2016 that not\n\n\nbeen applied by the Group are disclosed in Note F7.\n\n\n(viii) Critical accounting estimates\n\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the use\n\n\nof certain critical accounting estimates that involve a higher\n\n\ndegree of judgement or complexity. It also requires management\n\n\nto exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s\n\n\naccounting policies.\n\n\nThe Directors evaluate estimates and judgements incorporated\n\n\ninto these financial statements based on historical knowledge\n\n\nand best available current information. Estimates assume\n\n\na reasonable expectation of future events and are based on\n\n\ncurrent trends and economic data, obtained both externally\n\n\nand within the Company.\n\n\nThe resulting accounting estimates will, by definition,\n\n\nseldom equal the related actual results.\n\n\nDetails of critical accounting estimates and judgements can\n\n\nbe found in the notes to which they relate and include income\n\n\ntaxes B6, mining tenements C2, impairment of assets C3,\n\n\nexploration and evaluation assets C4, royalty receivable C9\n\n\nand provisions C10.\n\n\n\n(ix) Going concern\n\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2016, the Group had a loss\n\n\nafter income tax of $227.1 million (31 December 2015: loss after\n\n\nincome tax of $291.2 million) from continuing operations.\n\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern\n\n\nbasis, which contemplates the continuation of normal business\n\n\noperations and the realisation of assets and settlement of\n\n\nliabilities in the normal course of business. The Directors have\n\n\nconsidered and noted the following with regards to the ability\n\n\nof the Group to continue as a going concern:\n\n\n(i) \u0007At 31 December 2016, the Group has a cash balance\n\n\nof $190.3 million;\n\n\n(ii) \u0007At 31 December 2016, the Group has surplus net current\n\n\nassets of $240.9 million;\n\n\n(iii) \u0007The Directors of Yanzhou Coal Mining Company Limited\n\n\n(“Yanzhou”) have provided financial support in the form\n\n\nof a A$1.4 billion facility (US$681.5 million drawn) to support\n\n\nthe on-going operations and the expansion of the Group\n\n\nto enable it to pay its debts as and when they fall due, and\n\n\na US$807 million facility (US$136.0 million drawn) for\n\n\nthe seven percent coupon distribution of the Subordinated\n\n\nCapital Notes in the first five years;\n\n\n(iv) \u0007The Directors of Yanzhou have provided a letter of support\n\n\nwhereby unless revoked by giving not less than 24 month’s\n\n\nnotice, for so long as Yanzhou owns at least 51 percent of the\n\n\nshares of Yancoal, Yanzhou will ensure that Yancoal continues\n\n\nto operate so that it remains solvent.\n\n\nOn the basis of these factors, the Directors believe that the going\n\n\nconcern basis of preparation is appropriate and the Group will\n\n\nbe able to repay its debts as and when they fall due. In the event\n\n\nthat the Group cannot continue as a going concern, it may not\n\n\nrealise its assets and settle its liabilities in the normal course of\n\n\noperations and at the amounts stated in the financial statements.\n\n\n95\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\n_Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements_\n\n\n_31 December 2016_\n\n\n**B: PERFORMANCE**\n\n\nThis section of the financial statements focuses on disclosure that enhances a user’s understanding of profit after tax. Segment\n\n\nreporting provides a breakdown of profit, revenue and assets by geographic segment. The key line items of the Statement of Profit\n\n\nor Loss and Other Comprehensive Income along with their components provide details behind the reported balances.\n\n\n**B1: SEGMENT INFORMATION**\n\n\n**Accounting policy**\n\n\nManagement has determined the operating segments based on the strategic direction and organisational structure of the Group\n\n\ntogether with reports reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Makers (“CODM”), defined as the Executive Committee, that are\n\n\nused to make strategic decisions including resource allocation and assessment of segment performance.\n\n\nThe reportable segments are considered at a regional level being New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland (QLD).\n\n\nNon-operating items of the Group are presented under the segment “Corporate” which includes administrative expenses,\n\n\nforeign exchange gains and losses on interest-bearing liabilities, and the elimination of intersegment transactions and other\n\n\nconsolidation adjustments.\n\n\nOn 31 March 2016 Yancoal Australia Ltd transferred control of Watagan Mining Company Pty Ltd (“Watagan”) (refer to Note E1\n\n\nfor further details).

Revenue is recognised in the profit or loss as follows:\n\n\n(i) Sale of coal\n\n\nRevenue from the sale of coal is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed\n\n\nto the buyer and can be measured reliably. Risks and rewards are considered passed to the buyer at the time of delivery,\n\n\nusually on a Free On Board (“FOB”) basis. On occasion the sale of coal is recognised as the ship pulls into harbour\n\n\non a Free Alongside Ship (“FAS”) basis.\n\n\n99\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\n_Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements_\n\n\n_31 December 2016_\n\n\n**B: PERFORMANCE**\n\n\n\n**B2: REVENUE (CONTINUED)**\n\n\n(ii) Interest\n\n\nInterest income from a financial asset is accrued on a time\n\n\nbasis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the\n\n\neffective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly\n\n\ndiscounts the estimated future cash receipts through the\n\n\nexpected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying\n\n\namount. Interest income from a finance lease is recognised over\n\n\nthe term of the lease based on a pattern reflecting a constant\n\n\nperiodic rate of return on the net investment in the lease.\n\n\n**From continuing operations**\n\n\n**Sales revenue**\n\n\n\n(iii) Services\n\n\nRevenue from the rendering of a service is recognised upon\n\n\nthe delivery of the service to the customer.\n\n\n(iv) Other\n\n\nOther primarily consists of dividends, rents, sub-lease rental\n\n\nand management fees.

Employee benefits recognised in the profit or loss are net of recoveries.\n\n\n(ii) Superannuation\n\n\nContributions made by the Group to defined contribution superannuation funds are recognised as an expense in the period\n\n\nin which they are incurred.\n\n\n(iii) Wages and salaries, annual leave and sick leave\n\n\nLiabilities for employee benefits for wages, salaries, annual leave and accumulating sick leave that are expected to be wholly settled\n\n\nwithin 12 months of the reporting date represent present obligations resulting from employees’ services provided to the reporting\n\n\ndate and are calculated at undiscounted amounts based on wage and salary rates that the Group expects to pay as at the reporting\n\n\ndate including related on costs, such as superannuation, workers compensation, insurance and payroll tax and are included in trade\n\n\nand other payables. Non-accumulating, non-monetary benefits such as housing and cars are expensed by the Group as the benefits\n\n\nare used by the employee.\n\n\nEmployee benefits payable later than 12 months have been measured at the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be\n\n\nmade for those benefits. In determining the liability, consideration is given to employee salary and wage increases and the probability\n\n\nthat the employee may satisfy any vesting requirements.

However, the deferred\n\n\nincome tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial\n\n\nrecognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other\n\n\nthan a business combination that at the time of the transaction\n\n\naffects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred\n\n\nincome tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that\n\n\nhave been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the\n\n\nreporting period and are expected to apply when the related\n\n\ndeferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income\n\n\ntax liability is settled.\n\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary\n\n\ndifferences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that\n\n\nfuture taxable amounts will be available to utilise those\n\n\ntemporary differences and losses. The carrying value of the\n\n\ndeferred tax asset is reviewed at each reporting period and\n\n\nreduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that future\n\n\ntaxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the asset to\n\n\nbe recovered.\n\n\nDeferred tax liabilities and assets are recognised for taxable\n\n\ntemporary differences between the carrying amount and tax\n\n\nbases of investments in controlled entities, except where the\n\n\nparent entity is able to control the timing of the reversal of the\n\n\ntemporary differences and it is probable that the differences\n\n\nwill not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\n\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is\n\n\na legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and\n\n\nliabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the\n\n\nsame taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities\n\n\nare offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right\n\n\nto offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise\n\n\nthe asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n\nCurrent and deferred tax is recognised in the profit or loss,\n\n\nexcept to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other\n\n\ncomprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax\n\n\nis also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly\n\n\nin equity, respectively.\n\n\n**Tax consolidation legislation**\n\n\nYancoal Australia Ltd and its wholly owned Australian\n\n\ncontrolled entities have implemented the tax consolidation\n\n\nlegislation for income tax purposes. The accounting policy in\n\n\nrelation to this legislation is set out in Note E3.\n\n\n**Critical accounting estimates and judgements**\n\n\nThe Group is subject to income taxes in Australia. Significant\n\n\njudgement is required in determining the provision for income\n\n\ntaxes. Deferred tax assets, including those arising from\n\n\nunutilised tax losses, require the Group to assess the likelihood\n\n\nthat the Group will generate sufficient taxable earnings\n\n\nin future periods, in order to utilise recognised deferred tax\n\n\nassets. Judgement is also required in respect of the application\n\n\nof existing tax laws. Assumptions about the generation of future\n\n\ntaxable profits depend on management’s estimates of future\n\n\ncash flows. These estimates of future taxable income are based\n\n\non forecast cash flows from operations (which are impacted by\n\n\nproduction and sales volumes, coal prices, reserves, operating\n\n\ncosts, closure and rehabilitation costs, capital expenditure, and\n\n\nother capital management transactions). To the extent that future\n\n\ncash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates,\n\n\nthe ability of the Group to realise the net deferred tax assets\n\n\nrecorded at the reporting date could be impacted. In addition,\n\n\nfuture changes in tax laws could limit the ability of the Group to\n\n\nobtain tax deductions in future periods.\n\n\n103\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\n_Notes to the consolidated financial statements_\n\n\n_31 December 2016_\n\n\n**B: PERFORMANCE**\n\n\n**B6: TAXATION (CONTINUED)**\n**(a) Income tax (expense)/Benefit**\n\n\n**(i) Net tax benefit**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n**2016**\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n**2015**\n**$M**\n\n\n\nIncome tax benefit **73.0** 62.6\n\nIncome tax benefit true up **11.7**\n\nNet tax benefit is attributable to:\nContinuing operations **84.7** **62.6**\n\n\nDeferred tax benefit **84.7** **62.6**\n\n**(ii) Income tax benefit**\n\nDeferred tax benefit **84.7** **62.6**\n\nDeferred tax benefit included in income tax benefit comprises:\n\n\nIncrease in deferred tax assets (refer to Note B6(b)(i)) **156.9** 213.4\n\n\nDecrease in deferred tax liabilities (refer to Note B6(c)(i)) **(70.1)** (150.8)\n\nMovements in other including assets classified as held for sale **(2.1)**\n\n\n**84.7** **62.6**\n\n\n**(iii) Reconciliation of income tax benefit to prima facie tax payable**\n\n\nLoss from continuing operations before tax **(311.8)** (353.8)\n\n\nTax at the Australian tax rate of 30% (2015–30%) **93.6** 106.1\n\n\nTax effect of amounts which are not deductible/Taxable in calculating taxable income:\n\n\nStamp duty provision expensed **(3.7)**\n\nShare of profit/(loss) of equity-accounted investees not deductible **(1.5)** (11.2)\n\n\nGain on acquisition of subsidiaries 3.4\n\n\nPlant and equipment **7.9** (4.3)\n\n\nUnder/Over provision in prior years **11.7** (19.3)\n\n\nDenial of debt deductions **(18.7)** (15.8)\n\n\nOther **(4.6)** 3.7\n\n\n**Income tax benefit** **84.7** **62.6**\n\n\n**(iv) Amounts recognised directly in equity**\n\nAggregate current and deferred tax arising in the reporting period and not recognised in net profit or\n\n\nloss or other comprehensive income but directly debited or credited to equity:\n\nCash flow hedges **27.1** (133.9)\n\n\nSubordinated Capital Note transaction costs **(0.8)** 0.3\n\n\n**26.3** **(133.6)**\n\n\n104\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\n**(b) Deferred tax assets**\n\n\n**(i) Deferred tax assets**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n**2016**\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n**2015**\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Deferred tax assets from income tax** **1,339.1** **1,166.2**\n\n\n\n**Cash Flow**\n**Hedges** **Other** **Total**\n**$M** **$M** **$M**\n\n\n\n**Finance**\n\n**Lease**\n\n**Liabilities**\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Trade**\n**and Other**\n**Payables**\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Movements**\n\n\n**(ii) Income tax**\n\n\n\n**Tax Losses**\n**and Offsets** **Provisions**\n**$M** **$M**\n\n\n\n**At 1 January 2015** 511.7 40.6 16.6 12.5 244.1 11.3 836.8\n\n\nUnder/Over provision in prior year\n\n - to profit or loss 170.8 0.5 (126.8) 15.3 59.8\n\n\n - directly to equity 0.5 0.5\n\n\n - other (1.8) (1.8)\n\n(Charged)/Credited - to profit or loss 151.7 13.3 0.1 (2.6) (8.9) 153.6\n\n\n - directly to equity 133.9 (0.8) 133.1\n\n\n - other 4.9 4.9\n\nTransfer to assets classified\n(10.6) (7.0) (0.6) (2.5) (20.7)\nas held for sale\n\n\n**At 31 December 2015** **834.2** **43.3** **10.2** **9.3** **251.2** **18.0** **1,166.2**\n\n\n**At beginning of year** 834.2 43.3 10.2 9.3 251.2 18.0 1,166.2\n\n\nUnder/Over provision in prior year\n\n - to profit or loss (13.7) 0.2 23.8 (0.3) 10.0\n\n\n - to Watagan Group (12.1) (12.1)\n\n(Charged)/Credited - to profit or loss 149.4 (4.5) 4.6 11.0 (13.6) 146.9\n\n\n - directly to equity (40.0) 12.9 (27.1)\n\n\n - directly to other 0.9 0.9\n\n\n - tax loss recorded on behalf\n55.1 55.1\nof Watagan Group\n\n\nRe-recognised from Assets\n\nclassified as held for sale (0.8) (0.8)\n\n\n**At 31 December 2016** **972.9** **38.0** **15.0** **20.3** **287.9** **5.0** **1,339.1**\n\n\nThe Group’s tax consolidated group includes Watagan Mining Company Pty Ltd and its controlled subsidiaries, refer to E1b(i) for\n\n\nfurther details.

Mine development\n\n\nassets include all mining related development expenditure that\n\n\nis not included under land, buildings and plant and equipment.\n\n\nThe open pit operations capitalise mine development costs\n\n\nincluding both direct and indirect costs incurred to remove\n\n\noverburden and other waste materials to enable access to\n\n\nthe coal seams during the development of a mine before\n\n\ncommercial production commences, and during future\n\n\ndevelopment of new open pit mining areas. Amortisation\n\n\nof those capitalised costs over the life of the operation\n\n\ncommences at the time that commercial production begins for\n\n\nthe mine for the new open pit mining area. Underground mine\n\n\ndevelopment costs include both direct and indirect mining costs\n\n\nrelating to underground longwall panel development and mains\n\n\ndevelopment (primary access/egress roads for the mine).\n\n\nMains development costs are capitalised net of the coal sales\n\n\nrevenue earned from coal extracted as part of the mains\n\n\ndevelopment process.

Production\n\n\nstripping costs are capitalised as part of an asset, if it can be\n\n\ndemonstrated that it is probable that future economic benefits will\n\n\nbe realised, the costs can be reliably measured and the entity can\n\n\nidentify the component of the ore body for which access has been\n\n\nimproved. The asset is called “stripping activity asset” included in\n\n\nmine development.\n\n\nThe stripping activity asset is amortised on a systematic\n\n\nbasis, over the expected useful life of the identified component\n\n\nof the ore body that becomes more accessible as a result of the\n\n\nstripping activity. The units of production method shall be\n\n\napplied. Production stripping costs that do not satisfy the asset\n\n\nrecognition criteria are expensed.\n\n\nDepreciation and amortisation\n\n\nThe depreciable amount of all fixed assets, excluding freehold\n\n\nland, is depreciated on a straight-line or units of production\n\n\nbasis over the asset’s useful life to the Group based on life\n\n\nof mine plans and Joint Ore Reserves Committee “JORC”\n\n\nestimated reserves, commencing from the time the asset\n\n\nis held ready for use. Leased assets are depreciated over\n\n\nthe asset’s useful life or over the shorter of the asset’s useful\n\n\nlife and the lease term if there is no reasonable certainty\n\n\nthat the Group will obtain ownership at the end of the lease\n\n\nterm. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the period\n\n\nof the lease or estimated useful life, whichever is the shorter,\n\n\nusing the straight-line method.\n\n\nFor some assets, the useful life of the asset is linked to the\n\n\nlevel of production. In such cases, depreciation is charged on\n\n\na units of production basis based on the recoverable reserves\n\n\nor the remaining useful hours. Alternatively, the straight-line\n\n\nmethod may be used where this provides a suitable alternative\n\n\nbecause production is not expected to fluctuate significantly\n\n\nfrom one year to another.

Such an analysis requires complex geological judgements\n\n\nto interpret the data. The estimation of Recoverable Reserves\n\n\nis based on factors such as estimates of foreign exchange\n\n\nrates, coal price, future capital requirements, rehabilitation\n\n\nobligations and production costs, along with geological\n\n\nassumptions and judgements made in estimating the size\n\n\nand quality of the reserves.\n\n\n110\n\n\n\nManagement forms a view of forecast sales prices based\n\n\non current and long-term historical average price trend.\n\n\nAs the economic assumptions used may change and as\n\n\nadditional geological information is produced during the\n\n\noperations of a mine, estimates of reserves may change.\n\n\nAdditionally the amount of reserves that may actually be mined\n\n\nin the future and the Group’s current reserve estimate may\n\n\nvary. Such changes may impact the Group’s reported financial\n\n\nposition and results including:\n\n\n- The carrying value of the exploration and evaluation assets,\n\n\nmine properties, property, plant and equipment and goodwill\n\n\nmay be affected due to changes in estimated future cash flows;\n\n\n- Depreciation and amortisation charges in the statement\n\n\nof profit and loss and other comprehensive income may\n\n\nchange where such charges are determined using the units of\n\n\nproduction method, or where the useful life of the related assets\n\n\nchange; and\n\n\n- The carrying value of deferred income tax assets may change\n\n\ndue to changes in the judgements regarding the existence of\n\n\nsuch assets and in estimates of the likely recovery of such assets.\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\n**C3: IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS**\n\n\n**Accounting policies**\n\n\n(i) Long term assets\n\n\nMining tenements and goodwill are tested annually for\n\n\nimpairment, or more frequently if events or changes in\n\n\ncircumstances indicate that they might be impaired.\n\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or\n\n\nloss for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount\n\n\nexceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is\n\n\nthe higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and\n\n\nvalue in use. Mining tenements and other non-financial\n\n\nassets (excluding goodwill) that have previously suffered\n\n\nan impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the\n\n\nimpairment at the end of each reporting period.\n\n\nFor the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped\n\n\ninto Cash-Generating Units (“CGU”), being the lowest levels\n\n\nfor which there are separately identifiable cash inflows which\n\n\nare largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets\n\n\nor groups of assets. For the purposes of goodwill impairment\n\n\ntesting, CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are\n\n\naggregated so that the level at which impairment is tested\n\n\nreflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for\n\n\ninternal reporting purposes. The goodwill acquired in a\n\n\nbusiness combination, for the purpose of impairment testing,\n\n\nis allocated to CGUs that are expected to benefit from the\n\n\nsynergies of the combination.\n\n\nThe Group assesses impairment by evaluation of conditions\n\n\nand events specific to the Company that may be indicative\n\n\nof impairment triggers.\n\n\n\n(ii) Other financial assets\n\n\nThe Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether\n\n\nthere is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of\n\n\nfinancial assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of\n\n\nfinancial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred\n\n\nonly if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one\n\n\nor more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the\n\n\nasset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact\n\n\non the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group\n\n\nof financial assets that can be reliably estimated.\n\n\nIf there is evidence of impairment for any of the Group’s financial\n\n\nassets carried at amortised cost, the loss is measured as the\n\n\ndifference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present\n\n\nvalue of estimated future cash flows, excluding future credit\n\n\nlosses that have not been incurred. The cash flows are discounted\n\n\nat the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The loss is\n\n\nrecognised in profit or loss.\n\n\n**Critical accounting estimates and judgements**\n\n\nThe determination of fair value and value in use requires\n\n\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions about expected\n\n\nproduction and sales volumes, coal prices (considering current\n\n\nand historical prices, price trends and related factors), foreign\n\n\nexchange rates, coal Resources and Reserves (refer to C2),\n\n\noperating costs, closure and rehabilitation costs and future\n\n\ncapital expenditure. These estimates and assumptions are subject\n\n\nto risk and uncertainty; hence there is a possibility that changes\n\n\nin circumstances will alter these projections, which may impact\n\n\nthe recoverable amount of the assets. In such circumstances,\n\n\nsome or all of the carrying amount of the assets may be further\n\n\nimpaired or the impairment charge reduced with the impact\n\n\nrecorded in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n\n111\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\n_Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements_\n\n\n_31 December 2016_\n\n\n**C: OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES**\n\n\n**C3: IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS (CONTINUED)**\n\n\n**(a) CGU assessment**\n\n\nThe Group operates on a regional basis within NSW and as such the NSW mines are considered to be one CGU. The NSW regional\n\n\nCGU comprises the open cut mines Moolarben and Stratford/Duralie. Yarrabee and Middlemount are considered separate CGU’s due\n\n\nto location and ownership structure.\n\n\n**(b) Assessment of fair value**\n\n\nEach CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal has been determined using a discounted cash flow model over the expected\n\n\nlife on mine (10–25 years). The fair value model adopted has been categorised as level three in the fair value hierarchy.\n\n\nThe key assumptions in the model include:\n\n\n**Key Assumptions** **Description**\n\nCoal prices The Group’s cash flow forecasts are based on estimates of future coal prices, which assume\nbenchmark prices will revert to the group’s assessment of the long term real coal prices of USD\n66–USD 100 per tonne (2015: USD 55–USD 109 per tonne) for thermal and USD 104–USD\n165 per tonne (2015: USD 91–USD 166 per tonne) for metallurgical coal.\n\n\nThe Group receives long term forecast coal price data from multiple external sources\nwhen determining its benchmark coal price forecasts and then makes adjustments\nfor specific coal qualities.\n\n\nFor both thermal and metallurgical coal the Group’s forecast coal price is within\nthe range of external price forecasts.\n\n\nForeign exchange rates The long term AUD/USD forecast exchange rate of $0.73 (2015: $0.73) is based on external\nsources. The year-end AUD/USD exchange rate was $0.72 per the Reserve Bank of Australia.\n\n\nProduction and capital costs Production and capital costs are based on the Group’s estimate of forecast geological conditions,\nstage of existing plant and equipment and future production levels.\n\nThis information is obtained from internally maintained budgets, the five year business plan,\nlife of mine models, life of mine plans, JORC reports, and project evaluations performed by the\nGroup in its ordinary course of business.\n\n\nCoal Reserves and Resources See discussion at Note C2 Mining tenements for how the coal reserves and resources\nare determined.\n\n\nDiscount rate The Group has applied a post-tax discount rate of 10.5 percent (2015: 10.5 percent) to discount\nthe forecast future attributable post-tax cash flows.\n\nThe post-tax discount rate applied to the future cash flow forecasts represents an estimate\nof the rate the market would apply having regard to the time value of money and the risks specific\nto the asset for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted.\n\nThis rate is also consistent with the Group’s five year business plan, life of mine models\nand project evaluations performed in ordinary course of business.\n\n\n112\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\n**C3: IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS (CONTINUED)**\n\n\n**(b) Assessment of fair value (continued)**\n\n\nBased on the above assumptions at 31 December 2016 the\n\n\nrecoverable amount is determined to be above book value\n\n\nfor all CGU’s resulting in no further impairment.\n\n\nImpairment provisions recorded as at 31 December 2016\n\n\nare $104.5 million for Moolarben and $73.8 million for\n\n\nStratford and Duralie. Moolarben and Stratford and Duralie\n\n\nare both included in the NSW region CGU. Management\n\n\nmay consider reversals of the impairment provision\n\n\npreviously recognised if there is either an increase in the\n\n\naverage long term real revenue over the life of the mine\n\n\ndue to either an increase in USD coal prices, or a further\n\n\nweakening of the AUD/USD foreign exchange rate or a\n\n\ncombination of both, or further reductions in the current\n\n\nand life of mine operating costs, capital expenditure\n\n\nrequirements, or an increase in the reserves.\n\n\nIn determining the value assigned to each key assumption,\n\n\nmanagement has used: external sources of information;\n\n\nthe expertise of external consultants; as well as the\n\n\nexperience of experts within the Group to validate entity\n\n\nspecific assumptions such as coal reserves and resources.\n\n\nAdditionally various sensitivities have been determined\n\n\nand considered with respect to each of the key assumptions,\n\n\nfurther supporting the above fair value conclusions.\n\n\n**(c) Key sensitivity**\n\n\nThe most sensitive input in the fair value model is forecast\n\n\nrevenue, which is primarily dependent on estimated future\n\n\ncoal prices and the AUD/USD forecast exchange rate.\n\n\nIf coal prices were -10 percent LOM the recoverable amount\n\n\nwould exceed book value for all CGUs. If the AUD/USD\n\n\nlong term forecast exchange rate was $0.80 the recoverable\n\n\namount would exceed book value for all CGUs.\n\n\nGoodwill\n\n\nThe Yarrabee goodwill was not subject to an impairment\n\n\ncharge as the recoverable amount is greater than the\n\n\ncarrying value for this CGU.\n\n\n\n**C4: EXPLORATION AND EVALUATION ASSETS**\n\n\n**Accounting policy**\n\n\nExploration and evaluation expenditure incurred is\n\n\naccumulated in respect of each separately identifiable area\n\n\nof interest which is at the individual exploration permit or\n\n\nlicence level. These costs are only carried forward where\n\n\nthe right of tenure for the area of interest is current and to\n\n\nthe extent that they are expected to be recouped through\n\n\nsuccessful development and commercial exploitation, or\n\n\nalternatively, sale of the area, or where activities in the\n\n\narea have not yet reached a stage which permits reasonable\n\n\nassessment of the existence of economically recoverable\n\n\nreserves and active and significant operations in, or in\n\n\nrelation to, the area of interest are continuing.\n\n\nExploration and evaluation assets acquired in a business\n\n\ncombination are recognised at their fair value at the\n\n\nacquisition date. The carrying amount of exploration and\n\n\nevaluation assets are assessed for impairment when facts\n\n\nor circumstances suggest the carrying amount of the assets\n\n\nmay exceed their recoverable amount. A regular review\n\n\nis undertaken for each area of interest to determine the\n\n\nappropriateness of continuing to carry forward costs in\n\n\nrelation to each area of interest. Accumulated costs in relation\n\n\nto an abandoned area are written off in full in the period in\n\n\nwhich the decision to abandon the area is made. Once the\n\n\ntechnical feasibility and commercial viability of the extraction\n\n\nof mineral resources in an area of interest are demonstrable,\n\n\nthe exploration and evaluation assets attributable to that\n\n\narea of interest are first tested for impairment and then\n\n\nreclassified to mining tenements.\n\n\n**Critical accounting estimates and judgements**\n\n\nThe application of the Group’s accounting policy for\n\n\nexploration and evaluation expenditure requires judgement\n\n\nin determining whether it is likely that future economic\n\n\nbenefits are likely, which may be based on assumptions about\n\n\nfuture events or circumstances. Estimates and assumptions\n\n\nmay change if new information becomes available. If after\n\n\nexpenditure is capitalised information becomes available\n\n\nsuggesting that the recovery of expenditure is unlikely,\n\n\nthe amount capitalised is written off in the Consolidated\n\n\nStatement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income\n\n\nin the period when the new information becomes available.\n\n\n\n113\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\n_Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements_\n\n\n_31 December 2016_\n\n\n**C: OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES**\n\n\n**C4: EXPLORATION AND EVALUATION ASSETS (CONTINUED)**\n**Accounting policy**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n**2016**\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n**2015**\n**$M**\n\n\n\nOpening net book amount **590.5** 896.0\n\n\nRemeasurement through business combination 3.4\n\n\nOther additions **0.4** 2.2\n\n\nTransfers to mining tenements **(100.9)**\n\n\nTransfers from assets under construction **8.2**\n\nTransfer to assets classified as held for sale (311.1)\n\n\n**Closing net book amount** **498.2** **590.5**\n\n\n**C5: INTANGIBLES**\n\n\n**Accounting policies**\n\n\n(i) Goodwill\n\n\nGoodwill acquired in a business combination is recognised at cost and subsequently measured at cost less any impairment losses.\n\n\nThe cost represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and\n\n\ncontingent liabilities acquired.

The provision for rehabilitation costs has been calculation based on the present value of the\nfuture costs expected to be incurred in restoring affected mining areas, assuming current technologies.\n\n\n**Key estimate and judgement:**\nThe rehabilitation provision has been created based on managements’ internal estimates and assumptions\nrelating to the current economic environment, which management believes is a reasonable basis upon which\nto estimate the future liability.\n\n\nThese estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions,\nhowever actual rehabilitation costs will ultimately depend upon the future market prices for the necessary\ndecommissioning works and the timing of when the rehabilitation costs are incurred. Timing is dependent\nupon when the mines ceases to produce at economically viable rates, which in turn, will depend upon future\ncoal prices, which are inherently uncertain.\n\n\nTake-or-pay In acquiring part of a business or operation, an assessment is made on the fair value of the assets\nand liabilities under AASB 3 Business Combinations. Take-or-pay is the assessment of forecast excess\ncapacity for port and rail contracts. A provision was recognised for the discounted estimated excess\ncapacity. The provision has a finite life and will be released to profit or loss over the period in which\nexcess capacity is realised.\n\n\n**Key estimate and judgement:**\nThe provision is recognised and estimated based on management’s assessment of contracted port capacity\nversus forecast usage. This involves making assumptions about the probability, amount and timing of an\noutflow of resources embodying economic benefits.\n\n\nOther provisions The provision includes marketing services fee payable to Noble Group Limited deemed above market norms\nand make good provisions to cover the cost to ‘make good’ any hired equipment, in case any major overhaul\ncosts are incurred at the end of the lease period.\n\n\n119\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\n_Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements_\n\n\n_31 December 2016_\n\n\n**D: CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING**\n\n\nThe ability of the Group to fund the investment in its ongoing activities, invest in new opportunities and meet current commitments\n\n\nis dependent on available cash and access to third party capital.

The Directors do\n\n\nnot believe that the outcome of these claims will have a material\n\n\nimpact on the Group’s financial position.\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\n**D8: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT**\n\n\nThe Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks:\n\n\nmarket risk (including foreign exchange risk, price risk and\n\n\ninterest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s\n\n\noverall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability\n\n\nof financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse\n\n\neffects on the financial performance of the Group. The Group\n\n\nuses derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange\n\n\ncontracts to hedge certain risk exposures. Derivatives are\n\n\nexclusively used for hedging purposes and not as speculative\n\n\ninstruments. The Group uses different methods to measure\n\n\ndifferent types of risk to which it is exposed. These methods\n\n\ninclude sensitivity analysis in the case of foreign exchange,\n\n\ninterest rate risk and other price risks, and aging analysis\n\n\nfor credit risk.\n\n\nThe Group holds the following financial instruments:\n\n\n(i) Cash and cash equivalents;\n\n\n(ii) Trade and other receivables;\n\n\n(iii) Trade and other payables;\n\n\n(iv) \u0007Interest-bearing liabilities,\n\n\nincluding bank loans and finance leases;\n\n\n(v) Available-for-sale investments;\n\n\n(vi) Royalty receivable;\n\n\n(vii) Derivative financial instruments; and\n\n\n(viii) Interest-bearing loan from associate.\n\n\nThe Board of Directors has overall responsibility for determining\n\n\nrisk management objectives and policies and risk management\n\n\nis carried out by the Group Audit and Risk Management\n\n\ndepartment along with the Group Treasury department.\n\n\nThe Board provides written principles for overall risk\n\n\nmanagement, as well as policies covering specific areas\n\n\nsuch as the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate\n\n\nforeign exchange risk. These derivative instruments create\n\n\nan obligation or right that effectively transfers one or more\n\n\nof the risks associated with an underlying financial instrument,\n\n\nasset or obligation.\n\n\n\nThe overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek\n\n\nto reduce risk and volatility in financial performance without\n\n\nunduly affecting competitiveness and flexibility. Further details\n\n\nregarding these policies are set out below.\n\n\n**(a) Market risk**\n\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as\n\n\nforeign exchange rates, interest rates, securities prices, and coal\n\n\nprices, will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings\n\n\nof financial instruments.\n\n\n(i) Foreign exchange risk\n\n\nThe Group operates entirely in Australia and its costs are\n\n\nprimarily denominated in its functional currency, the Australian\n\n\ndollar. Export coal sales are denominated in US dollars and a\n\n\nstrengthening of the Australian dollar against the US dollar\n\n\nhas an adverse impact on earnings and cash flow settlement.\n\n\nLiabilities for some plant and equipment purchases and loans are\n\n\ndenominated in currencies other than the Australian dollar and\n\n\na weakening of the Australian dollar against other currencies has\n\n\nan adverse impact on earnings and cash flow settlement.\n\n\nThe hedging policy of the Group aims to protect against the\n\n\nvolatility of cash expenditures or reduced collection in the above\n\n\nmentioned transactions as well as to reduce the volatility of profit\n\n\nor loss for retranslation of US dollar denominated loans at each\n\n\nperiod end.\n\n\nHedging through bank issued instruments\n\n\nOperating foreign exchange risk that arises from firm\n\n\ncommitments or highly probable transactions are managed\n\n\nthrough the use of bank issued forward foreign currency\n\n\ncontracts and collar option contracts. The Group hedges a\n\n\nportion of contracted US dollar sales and asset purchases settled\n\n\nin foreign currencies in each currency to mitigate the adverse\n\n\nimpact on cash flow due to the future rise or fall in Australian\n\n\ndollars against the relevant currencies.\n\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives\n\n\nthat are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised\n\n\nin Other Comprehensive Income in the hedging reserve until the\n\n\nanticipated underlying transaction occurs.\n\n\n129\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\n_Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements_\n\n\n_31 December 2016_\n\n\n**D: CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING**\n\n\n**D8: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)**\n\n\n**(a) Market risk (continued)**\n\n\nOnce the anticipated underlying transaction occurs, amounts accumulated in equity are recycled through the profit or loss or\n\n\nrecognised as part of the cost of the asset to which it relates. The ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are\n\n\ndesignated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised immediately in the profit or loss. In the current period, the loss relating to\n\n\nthe ineffective portion was $nil (2015: nil).\n\n\nNatural cash flow hedge\n\n\nThe Group currently does not use bank issued instruments to hedge foreign exchange risks in respect of US dollar denominated loans,\n\n\nhowever, the scheduled repayment of the principal on US dollar loans is designated to hedge the cash flow risks on the portion of\n\n\nforecast US dollar sales that are not hedged through bank issued instruments (“natural cash flow hedge”). US dollar loan repayments\n\n\nup to a six-month period are designated to hedge the forecast US dollar sales during the same period after the designation of the hedge\n\n\nrelationship based on a dollar for dollar basis until the hedge ratio reaches one.\n\n\nHedging effectiveness is determined by comparing the changes in the hedging instruments and hedged sales. Hedge ineffectiveness\n\n\nwill occur when cash flows generated by sales transactions are lower than the forecast sales transaction. In cases of hedge\n\n\nineffectiveness, gains or losses in relation to the excess portion in the foreign exchange movement of the designated US dollar loan\n\n\nrepayment will be recycled to profit or loss. The effective portion of changes in the hedging instruments will be recognised in the cash\n\n\nflow hedge reserve in Other Comprehensive Income. When the sales transactions occur, amounts accumulated in equity are recycled\n\n\nthrough the profit or loss as an increase or decrease to sales revenue.\n\n\nRoyalty receivable\n\n\nThe royalty receivable from the Middlemount Joint Venture is estimated based on expected future cash flows that are dependent\n\n\non sales volumes, US dollar denominated coal prices and the US dollar foreign exchange rate (refer to Note C9).\n\n\nThe Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk at the end of the reporting period, expressed in Australian dollars, was as follows:\n\n\n**(i) Foreign exchange risk (continued)**\n\n\n**31 December 2016** **31 December 2015**\n\n\n**USD** **RMB*** **USD** **RMB***\n**$M** **$M** **$M** **$M**\n\n\nCash and cash equivalents **124.1** **0.5** 29.9 95.7\n\n\nTrade receivables **164.7** 87.0\n\n\nRoyalty receivable **198.9** 204.9\n\n\nTrade and other payables **(156.6)** (77.9)\n\n\nInterest bearing liabilities **(4,883.3)** (4,700.7)\n\nDerivative financial instruments **(0.6)** (1.0)\n\n\n**Net Exposure** **(4,552.8)** **0.5** **(4,456.8)** **94.7**\n\n\n*\u0007The cash and cash equivalents balance in RMB was $0.5 million on 14 January 2016.

Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, favourable derivative financial\n\n\ninstruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to wholesale and retail customers,\n\n\nincluding outstanding receivables and committed transactions. For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated\n\n\nparties with a minimum rating of ‘A’ are accepted. If wholesale customers are independently rated, these ratings are used.\n\n\nOtherwise, if there is no independent rating, the marketing department assesses the credit quality of the customer, taking\n\n\ninto account its financial position, past experience and other factors.\n\n\nCredit risk in trade receivables is managed in the following ways:\n\n\n(i) Payment terms and credit limits are set for individual customers;\n\n\n(ii) A risk assessment process is used for all customers; and\n\n\n(iii) Letters of credit are required for those customers assessed as posing a higher risk.\n\n\nThe maximum exposure to credit risk on financial assets which have been recognised in the balance sheet is their carrying\n\n\namount less impairment provision, if any as set out below.\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n**2016**\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n**2015**\n**$M**\n\n\n\nCash and cash equivalents **222.2** 159.0\n\n\nTrade and other receivables **842.6** 635.3\n\n\n**1,064.8** **794.3**\n\n\n2015 amounts above includes cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables associated with assets classified\n\n\nas held for sale.\n\n\nIncluded in trade and other receivables are significant customers located in Australia, Singapore, South Korea and China\n\n\nthat account for 46 percent, 22 percent, seven percent and four percent of trade receivables respectively (2015: 46 percent,\n\n\n22 percent, seven percent and four percent).\n\n\nAt 31 December 2016, derivative financial instruments were in a net liability position (2015: net liability position).\n\n\nAs a result no credit risk has been disclosed above.\n\n\n134\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\n**(c) Liquidity risk**\n\n\nLiquidity risk includes the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.

AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement\n\n\nrequires disclosure of fair value measurements by level in accordance with the following fair value measurement hierarchy:\n\n\n(a) Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1);\n\n\n(b) \u0007Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices)\n\n\nor indirectly (derived from prices) (level 2); and\n\n\n(c) Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) (level 3).\n\n\nThe following table presents the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities measured and recognised at fair value at 31 December\n\n\n2016 and 31 December 2015:\n\n\n**Level 1** **Level 2** **Level 3** **Total**\n**$M** **$M** **$M** **$M**\n\n\n**31 December 2016**\n\n**Assets**\n\n\nRoyalty receivable **198.9** **198.9**\n\n\n**Total assets** **198.9** **198.9**\n\n\n**Liabilities**\n\n\nDerivatives used for hedging\n\n\nForward foreign exchange contracts **0.6** **0.6**\n\n\n**Total liabilities** **0.6** **0.6**\n\n\n**31 December 2015**\n\n**Assets**\n\n\nRoyalty receivable 204.9 204.9\n\n\n**Total assets** **204.9** **204.9**\n\n\n**Liabilities**\n\n\nDerivatives used for hedging\n\n\nForward foreign exchange contracts 1.0 1.0\n\n\nOther derivatives\n\n\n**Total liabilities** **1.0** **1.0**\n\n\n(ii) Valuation techniques\n\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation techniques.\n\n\nThese valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available. If all significant inputs required\n\n\nto fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level two. If one or more of the significant inputs is not\n\n\nbased on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. This is the case for the royalty receivable.\n\n\n136\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\nThe valuation techniques used for level 2 financial instruments are:\n\n\n**Description** **Valuation Technique(s)** **Inputs Used**\n\nForward Foreign Exchange Contracts Income approach using discount cash flow Current forward exchange rates applicable to\nmethodology remaining life of contract\n\n\n(iii) Fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (level 3)\n\n\nThe following table presents the changes in level 3 instruments for the year ended 31 December 2016:\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n**2016**\n**Royalty Receivable**\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n**2015**\n**Royalty Receivable**\n**$M**\n\n\n\nOpening balance **204.9** 199.2\n\n\nCash received/Receivable **(20.5)** (17.9)\n\n\nUnwinding of the discount **20.9** 21.2\n\nRemeasurement of the royalty receivable recognised in profit and loss **(6.4)** 2.4\n\n\n**Closing balance** **198.9** **204.9**\n\n\nRoyalty receivable\n\n\nThe fair value of the royalty receivable is the fair value of the right to receive a royalty of four percent of Free on Board Trimmed\n\n\nSales from the Middlemount Mine. The financial asset has a finite life being the life of the Middlemount Mine and will be measured\n\n\non a fair value basis.\n\n\nThe fair value is determined using the discounted future cash flows that are dependent on the following unobservable inputs:\n\n\nforecast sales volumes, coal prices and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The forecast sales volumes are based on the internally\n\n\nmaintained budgets, five year business plan and life of mine models. The forecast coal prices and long term exchange rates are based\n\n\non external data consistent with the data used for impairment assessments (refer to Note C3). The risk-adjusted post-tax discount\n\n\nrate used to determine the future cash flows is 10.5 percent.\n\n\nThe estimated fair value could increase significantly if the following unobservable inputs of sales volumes and coal prices were\n\n\nhigher and if the Australian dollar weakens against the US dollar. The estimated fair value would also increase if the risk-adjusted\n\n\ndiscount rate was lower.\n\n\n(iv) Fair values of other financial instruments\n\n\nThe carrying amount is approximate to the fair value for the following:\n\n\n(i) Trade and other receivables;\n\n\n(ii) Other financial assets;\n\n\n(iii) Trade and other payables;\n\n\n(iv) Interest-bearing liabilities.\n\n\n137\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\n_Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements_\n\n\n_31 December 2016_\n\n\n**E: GROUP STRUCTURE**\n\n\n\nThis section explains significant aspects of the Groups\n\n\nstructure including interests in other entities, related party\n\n\ntransactions, parent entity information, controlled entities\n\n\nand the deed of cross guarantee.\n\n\n**E1: INTERESTS IN OTHER ENTITIES**\n\n\n**Accounting policies**\n\n\n(i) Associates\n\n\nAssociates are all entities over which the Group has significant\n\n\ninfluence but not control or joint control, generally accompanying\n\n\na shareholding of between 20 percent and 50 percent of the\n\n\nvoting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using\n\n\nthe equity method of accounting, after initially being recognised\n\n\nat cost. The Group’s investments in associates includes goodwill\n\n\nidentified on acquisition.\n\n\nThe Group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition profits\n\n\nor losses is recognised in profit or loss, and its share of\n\n\npost-acquisition other comprehensive income is recognised\n\n\nin other comprehensive income. The cumulative post-acquisition\n\n\nmovements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the\n\n\ninvestment.

Joint control exists only when the strategic, financial\n\n\nand operational policy decisions relating to the activities of the\n\n\njoint arrangement require the unanimous consent of the parties\n\n\nsharing control.\n\n\nA joint arrangement is either a joint operation or a joint venture.\n\n\nThe structure of each joint arrangement is analysed to determine\n\n\nwhether the joint arrangement is a joint operation or a joint\n\n\nventure. The classification of a joint arrangement is dependent\n\n\non the rights and obligations of the parties to the arrangement.\n\n\nJoint operations\n\n\nThe Group recognises its proportional right to the assets,\n\n\nliabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations and its\n\n\nshare of any jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenues\n\n\nand expenses. These have been incorporated in the financial\n\n\nstatements under the appropriate headings.\n\n\n138\n\n\n\nJoint ventures\n\n\nA joint venture is structured through a separate vehicle\n\n\nand the parties have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.\n\n\nJoint ventures are accounted for using the equity method where\n\n\nthe assets and liabilities will be aggregated into one line item on\n\n\nthe face of the consolidated balance sheet, after adjusting for the\n\n\nshare of profit or loss after tax, which is shown as a separate line\n\n\nitem on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss\n\n\nand Other Comprehensive Income, after adjusting for amounts\n\n\nrecognised directly in equity.\n\n\nWhen the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals\n\n\nor exceeds its interest in the joint venture (which includes\n\n\nany long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the\n\n\nGroup’s net investment in the joint venture), the Group does\n\n\nnot recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations\n\n\nor made payments on behalf of the joint venture.\n\n\nUnrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint\n\n\nventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in\n\n\nthe joint ventures. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless\n\n\nthe transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset\n\n\ntransferred.

Under the shareholder agreement between\n\n\nthe Group and other shareholders, the Group has 27 percent\n\n\nof the voting power of NCIG. The Group has the right to appoint\n\n\na director and is currently represented on the Board to partake\n\n\nin policy-making processes.\n\n\nWatagan Mining Company Pty Limited\n\n\nDuring 2015 the Group established a 100 percent owned\n\n\nsubsidiary, Watagan Mining Company Pty Ltd (“Watagan”).\n\n\nOn 18 February 2016, the Group executed a Bond Subscription\n\n\nAgreement, together with other agreements (the “Watagan\n\n\nAgreements”) that, on completion, transferred the Group’s\n\n\ninterest in three of its 100 percent owned NSW coal mining\n\n\noperations, being the Austar, Ashton and Donaldson coal mines\n\n\n(the “three mines”), to Watagan for a purchase price of $1,363.4\n\n\nmillion (an amount equal to the book value of the three mines\n\n\nat completion). The purchase price was funded by way of a\n\n\n$1,363.4 million loan from Yancoal Australia Ltd to Watagan\n\n\nbearing interest at BBSY plus 7.06 percent with a maturity date\n\n\nof 1 April 2025. The outstanding interest and principal of this\n\n\nloan is guaranteed by Yankuang Group Co., Ltd (“Yankuang”),\n\n\nthe Group’s ultimate parent entity. The completion date of the\n\n\ntransaction was 31 March 2016.\n\n\n\nOn completion Watagan issued US$775 million of secured debt\n\n\nbonds with a term of approximately nine years to three external\n\n\nfinanciers (“Bondholders”). Watagan will issue up to a further\n\n\nUS$175 million of debt bonds to one of the Bondholders prior\n\n\nto 31 March 2017. The Bondholders will receive interest on the\n\n\nface value outstanding on the bonds comprising a fixed interest\n\n\ncomponent, as well as a variable interest component that is\n\n\ntied to the EBITDA performance of Watagan. Under the terms\n\n\nof the Watagan Agreements, it was determined that upon\n\n\nissuance of the bonds the Group lost control of Watagan.\n\n\nThis loss of control was determined to occur on the issuance\n\n\ndate of the bonds on the basis that the power over the key\n\n\noperating and strategic decisions of Watagan no longer reside\n\n\nwith the Group. Specifically, those powers were transferred\n\n\nto the Bondholders under the terms of the Watagan Agreements\n\n\nas the Bondholders were given control of Watagan’s board of\n\n\ndirectors via appointment of the majority of directors. This loss\n\n\nof control resulted in the Group de-consolidating the consolidated\n\n\nresults of Watagan from the transaction completion date and\n\n\nthe Group began to equity account for its 100 percent equity\n\n\ninterest in Watagan as an associate. At 31 December 2015 due\n\n\nto the Watagan transaction being near completion, and that the\n\n\ntransaction was considered to be highly likely, the three mines\n\n\nwere disclosed as Assets Classified as Held for Sale.\n\n\n139\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\n_Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements_\n\n\n_31 December 2016_\n\n\n**E: GROUP STRUCTURE**\n\n\n\n**E1: INTERESTS IN OTHER ENTITIES (CONTINUED)**\n\n\n(i) Investment in associates (continued)\n\n\nWhile Watagan is deconsolidated for accounting purposes,\n\n\nas a result of the Group’s ongoing 100 percent equity ownership\n\n\nit remains within the Group’s tax consolidated group.\n\n\nThe Group’s ongoing involvement with Watagan together\n\n\nwith the Bond Subscription Agreement, the Watagan Agreements\n\n\ninclude a:\n\n\n- 10 year Management and Mine Services Agreement appointing\n\n\n(i)Yancoal as the exclusive provider of management services\n\n\n(being back office support functions) to the Watagan group;\n\n\nand (ii) a 100 percent owned Yancoal subsidiary as the exclusive\n\n\nprovider of all mining management services (being all work\n\n\ndirectly concerned with the management of the operations\n\n\nof the three mines) to the Watagan group; and\n\n\n- 10 year Marketing and Logistics Representation and Logistics\n\n\nAgreement appointing Yancoal as (i) the sole and exclusive\n\n\nmarketing and logistics representative of the Watagan group\n\n\nfor the promotion, marketing, sale, transportation and handling\n\n\nof all saleable coal produced from the three mines and the\n\n\npurchase of any coal for the Watagan group from third parties;\n\n\nand (ii) the sole and exclusive provider of infrastructure\n\n\nservices and representative of the Watagan group in relation\n\n\nto management of the port and rail access and rail haulage\n\n\ncontracts in relation to the three mines.\n\n\nThese agreements can be terminated without cause by either\n\n\nparty subject to certain termination payments.\n\n\nGiven the Group maintains one seat on the Watagan board\n\n\nand has ongoing involvement under the terms of the Watagan\n\n\nAgreements, the Group was determined to have significant\n\n\ninfluence over Watagan. As a result, the Group equity accounts\n\n\nits 100 percent equity interest from 31 March 2016. The Group\n\n\nwill account for the $1,363.4 million loan from Watagan\n\n\nconsistent with its accounting policy for financial assets.\n\n\nAccordingly this loan will be subject to impairment testing when\n\n\nthere is objective evidence that the loan is impaired.

Additionally, the Bondholders\n\n\nhave a put option that allows them to put the issued debt bonds\n\n\nto Yankuang at approximately years three, five, seven, and nine\n\n\nof the bond term, or on an event of default after year three.\n\n\nExercise of this put option would also result in the Group\n\n\nregaining control of Watagan.

Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from\n\n\nthe settlement of such transactions and from the translation\n\n\nat year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities\n\n\ndenominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or\n\n\nloss, except when they are deferred in equity as qualifying cash\n\n\nflow hedges.\n\n\nNon-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign\n\n\ncurrency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when\n\n\nthe fair value was determined. Translation differences on assets\n\n\nand liabilities carried at fair value are reported as part of the fair\n\n\nvalue gain or loss. Non-monetary items that are measured in\n\n\nterms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using\n\n\nthe exchange rate at the date of the transaction.\n\n\n158\n\n\n\n**F6: NEW AND AMENDED STANDARDS**\n\n**ADOPTED BY THE GROUP**\n\n\nThe Group was not required to change any of its accounting\n\n\npolicies as the result of new or revised accounting standards\n\n\nwhich became effective for the annual reporting period\n\n\ncommencing on 1 January 2016. The new standards that are\n\n\napplicable to for the first time for the year ended 31 December\n\n\n2016 are:\n\n\n- AASB 1057—Application of Australian Accounting Standards;\n\n\n- AASB 2014-4—Amendments to Australian Accounting\n\n\nStandards—Clarification of Acceptable Methods of\n\n\nDepreciation and Amortisation;\n\n\n- AASB 2014-9—Equity Accounting in Separate\n\n\nFinancial Statements;\n\n\n- AASB 2014-10—Sale or Contribution of Assets between\n\n\nAn Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture;\n\n\n- AASB 2015-1—Amendments to Australian Accounting\n\n\nStandard—Annual Improvements to Australian Accounting\n\n\nStandards 2012-2014 Cycle;\n\n\n- AASB 2015-3—Amendments to Australian Accounting\n\n\nStandards arising from the Withdrawal of AASB 1031\n\n\nMateriality;\n\n\n- AASB 2015-4—Amendments to Australian Accounting\n\n\nStandards—Financial Reporting Requirements for Australian\n\n\nGroups with a Foreign Parent;\n\n\n- AASB 2015-5—Amendments to Australian\n\n\nAccounting Standards—Investment Entities: Applying\n\n\nthe Consolidation Exception;\n\n\n- AASB 2015-9—Amendments to Australian Accounting\n\n\nStandards—Scope and Application Paragraphs.\n\n\nThese standards have introduced new disclosures for the\n\n\nAnnual Financial Report but did not affect the Group’s\n\n\naccounting policies or any of the amounts recognised\n\n\nin the financial statements.\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\n**F7: NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS**\n\n\nCertain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for 31 December 2016\n\n\nreporting periods and have not been early adopted by the Group. The Group’s assessment of the impact of these new standards\n\n\nand interpretations is set out below.\n\n\n**Reference** **Application Date**\n**and Title** **Details of New Standard/Amendment/Interpretation** **for the Group**\n\n\n\nAASB 9 **Financial Instruments**\nAmends the requirements for classification and measurement of financial assets. The available-for-sale\nand held-to-maturity categories of financial assets in AASB 139 have been eliminated. Under AASB 9,\nthere are three categories of financial assets:\na) Amortised cost\nb) Fair value through profit or loss\nc) Fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\n\nThe following requirements have generally been carried forward unchanged from AASB 139 Financial\nInstruments: Recognition and Measurement into AASB 9:\na) Classification and measurement of financial liabilities; and\nb) Derecognition requirements for financial assets and liabilities.\n\nHowever, AASB 9 requires that gains or losses on financial liabilities measured at fair value are recognised\nin profit or loss, except that the effects of changes in the liability’s credit risk are recognised in other\ncomprehensive income.\n\n\nImpact: Although the Directors anticipate that the adoption of AASB 9 may have an impact on the Group’s\nfinancial instruments, including hedging activity, it is impracticable at this stage to provide a reasonable\nestimate of such impact.\n\n\nAASB 16 **Leases**\n\nThis standard introduces a single lessee accounting model that eliminates the requirement for leases\nto be classified as operating or finance leases. The main changes introduced by the new standard include:\n\n\na) Recognition of a right-to-use asset and liability for all leases (excluding short term leases with\n\u0007less than 12 months of tenure an leases relating to low value assets);\nb) Deprecation of right-to-use assets in-line with AASB 116 Property, plant and equipment in profit\nor loss and unwinding of the liability in principal and interest components;\nc) Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate are included in the initial measurement\nof the lease liability using the index or rate at the commencement date;\nd) By applying a practical expedient, a lessee is permitted to elect not to separate non-lease components\nand instead account all components as a lease; and\ne) Additional disclosure requirements.\n\nImpact: Although the Directors anticipate that the adoption of AASB 16 will impact the Group’s financial\nstatements, it is impracticable at this stage to provide a reasonable estimate of such impact.\n\n\nAASB 15 **Revenue from Contracts with Customers**\nAn entity will recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an\namount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods\nor services. This means that revenue will be recognised when control of goods or services is transferred,\nrather than on transfer of risks and rewards as is currently the case under AASB 118 Revenue\n\n\nImpact: The Directors anticipate that the adoption of AASB 15 will be no impact on recognition of amounts\nin the Group’s financial statements, there will be additional disclosures required.\n\n\nAASB **Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards (Part E)**\n2014–1 Part E of this Standard defers the application date of AASB 9: Financial Instruments (December 2010)\nto annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. This part also makes consequential\namendments to hedge accounting disclosures set out in AASB 7: Financial Instruments: Disclosures, and\nto AASB 132: Financial Instruments: Presentation to permit irrevocable designation of “own use contracts”\nas measured at fair value through profit or loss if the designation eliminates or significantly reduces an\naccounting mismatch.\n\n\nImpact: The Group is currently adhering to this standard and there is no material impact expected\non the Group’s financial report.\n\n\n\n1 January 2018\n\n\n1 January 2018\n\n\n1 January 2018\n\n\n1 January 2018\n\n\n159\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\n_Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements_\n\n\n_31 December 2016_\n\n\n**F: OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n\n**F7: NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS (CONTINUED)**\n\n\n**Reference** **Application Date**\n**and Title** **Details of New Standard/Amendment/Interpretation** **for the Group**\n\n\n\nAASB 2014–10 **Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards—Sale or Contribution of Assets between**\n**an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture.**\n\nThis Standard amends AASB 10: Consolidated Financial Statements with regards to a parent losing\ncontrol over a subsidiary that is not a “business” as defined in AASB 3 to an associate or joint venture, and\nrequires that:\n\n\na) A gain or loss (including any amounts in other comprehensive income (OCI)) be recognised\nonly to the extent of the unrelated investor’s interest in that associate or joint venture;\nb) The remaining gain or loss be eliminated against the carrying amount of the investment\nin that associate or joint venture; and\nc) Any gain or loss from remeasuring the remaining investment in the former subsidiary at fair\nvalue also be recognised only to the extent of the unrelated investor’s interest in the associate\nor joint venture. The remaining gain or loss should be eliminated against the carrying amount\nof the remaining investment.\n\n\nThe application of AASB 2014–10 will result in a change in accounting policies for transactions\nof loss of control over subsidiaries (involving an associate or joint venture) that are businesses\nper AASB 3 for which gains or losses were previously recognised only to the extent of the unrelated\ninvestor’s interest.\n\n\nImpact: The Group is currently adhering to this standard and there is no material impact expected\non the Group’s financial report.\n\n\nAASB 2016–1 **Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards—Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets**\n**for Unrealised Losses**\nThis standard clarifies that deferred tax asset recognition on unrealised losses arising from assets\nmeasured at fair value in the financial statements should be done after taking in to account any restrictions\nimposed under tax laws on the source of taxable profits against which the deductible temporary\ndifferences can be offset. Further the future taxable profits should not include any amounts that are reversal\nof the deductible temporary differences.\n\n\nImpact: The Group is currently adhering to this standard and there is no material impact expected\non the Group’s financial report.\n\n\nAASB 2016–2 **Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards—Disclosure Initiative:**\n**Amendments to AASB 107**\nThe amendment to AASB 107 introduces additional disclosures that will enable users of financial statements\nto evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities. The amendment requires disclosure of\nchanges arising from:\n\n\n                 Cash flows, such as drawdowns and repayments of borrowings, and\n\n                 - Non-cash changes, such as acquisitions, disposals and unrealised exchange differences.\n\n\nImpact: The Group is currently adhering to this standard and there is no material impact expected\non the Group’s financial report.\n\n\nAASB 2016–5\n**Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards—Classification and Measurement**\n**of Share-based Payment Transactions**\nThis standard provides guidance on treatment of vesting conditions in a cash-settled share based\npayment arrangement that are similar to what has been prescribed for equity settled share based payment\narrangements. It also clarifies that, subject to certain exceptions, share based payment transactions with\nnet-settlement feature on account of withholding tax obligations should be classified in entirety as equity\nsettled share based payment.\n\n\nImpact: Since the group does not have a policy of cash-settled share based awards or net-settlement\nfeatures in equity settled plans, this standard is not expected to impact the Group’s financial statements.\n\n\n160\n\n\n\n1 January 2018\n\n\n1 January 2017\n\n\n1 January 2017\n\n\n1 January 2018\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\n_Directors’ Declaration_\n\n\n_31 December 2016_\n\n\nIn the Directors’ opinion:\n\n\n(a)\u0007 \u0007The financial statements and notes set out on pages 42 to 160 are in accordance with the _Corporations_\n\n\n_Act 2001_, including:\n\n\n(i) \u0007Complying with Accounting Standards, the Corporations Regulations 2001 and other mandatory professional\n\n\nreporting requirements; and\n\n\n(ii) \u0007Giving a true and fair view of the Group’s financial position as at 31 December 2016 and of its performance\n\n\nfor the year ended on that date, and\n\n\n(b) \u0007There are reasonable grounds to believe that the Company will be able to pay its debts as and when they become\n\n\ndue and payable; and\n\n\n(c) \u0007At the date of this declaration, there are reasonable grounds to believe that the members of the extended closed\n\n\ngroup identified in Note E5 will be able to meet any obligations or liabilities to which they are, or may become,\n\n\nsubject by virtue of the deed of cross guarantee described in Note E5.\n\n\nNote (i) confirms that the financial statements also comply with International Financial Reporting Standards\n\n\nas issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.\n\n\nThe Directors have been given the declarations by the chief executive officer and chief financial officer required\n\n\nby section 295A of the _Corporations Act 2001_ .\n\n\nThis declaration is made in accordance with a resolution of Directors.\n\n\n**Baocai Zhang**\nDirector\n\n28 February 2017\n\n\n\n161\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\n_Independent Auditor’s Report_\n\n\n162\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\n\n163\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\n_Independent Auditor’s Report_\n\n\n164\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\n\n165\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\n_Independent Auditor’s Report_\n\n\n166\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\n\n167\n\n\n**ANNUAL REPORT 2016**\n\n\n_Shareholder Information_\n\n\n**ORDINARY FULLY PAID (TOTAL) AS OF 31 MAR 2017**\n**Range of Units Snapshot**\n\n\n**Range** **Total holders** **Units** **% of Issued Capital**\n\n\n1–1,000 956 331,579 0.03\n\n\n1,001–5,000 526 1,304,890 0.13\n\n\n5,001–10,000 132 1,070,376 0.11\n\n\n10,001–100,000 179 5,614,501 0.56\n\n\n100,001–9,999,999,999 40 985,955,313 99.16\n\n\n**Rounding** **0.01**\n\n\n**Total** **1,833** **994,276,659** **100**\n\n\n**Unmarketable parcels**\n\n\n**Range** **Minimum Parcel Size** **Holders** **Units**\n\n\nMinimum $500 Parcel at $0.3950 per unit 1266 1028 415649\n\n\n**ORDINARY FULLY PAID (TOTAL) AS OF 31 MAR 2017**\n**Range of Units Snapshot**\n\n\n**Rank** **Name** **Units** **% of Units**\n\n\n1.
