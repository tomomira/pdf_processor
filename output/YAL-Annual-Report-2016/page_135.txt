(c) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk includes the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group will be
impacted in the following ways:
(i)	 Will not have sufficient funds to settle transactions on the due date;
(ii)	 Will be forced to sell financial assets at a value which is less than what they are worth; or
(iii)	May be unable to settle or recover a financial asset at all.
Liquidity risk is managed by maintaining sufficient cash and liquid deposit balances and having readily accessible standby facilities
in place in accordance with the Board’s risk management policy. Details regarding finance facilities are set out in Note D2.
Maturities of financial liabilities
The tables below analyse the Group’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on their contractual maturities for:
(a)	 All non-derivative financial liabilities; and
(b)	 Net and gross settled derivative financial instruments for which the contractual maturities are essential for an understanding
of the timing of the cash flows.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows including interest payments. Balances due within
12 months equal their carrying balances as the impact of discounting is not significant.
