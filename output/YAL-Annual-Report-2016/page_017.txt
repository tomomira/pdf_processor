ANNUAL REPORT 2016
Stage Two development activity also
included the opening of the box cut
for the new open cut mine in July and
preparations for a major recruitment
campaign to launch in mid 2017.
At the beginning of the year we
restructured the Company to secure
necessary debt-funding, transferring
control of the underground mines of
Ashton, Austar and Donaldson to new
fully-owned subsidiary, Watagan.
Under long term contracts to provide
management, marketing, infrastructure
and corporate support services to
Watagan, we continue to ensure the mines
are working to the highest legislative and
safety standards.
All operations remain steadfast in their
commitment to never compromising safety
and continue to implement ongoing safety
training, site improvements and workplace
strategies to address potential hazards.
There are no shortcuts when considering
the safety of the men and women directly
responsible every day for helping ensure
Yancoal’s success.
Throughout the past three years
Yancoal has efficiently restructured
its operations, reduced costs and
established itself as a leading coal
producer committed to investing
in the Australian resources sector.
For the year ahead we are focused
on growing our market share and
continuing to build on an established
history of quality product, certainty
of delivery and strategic acquisitions.
As announced 24 January 2017,
the proposed acquisition of 100 percent
of the shares in Coal & Allied represents
an opportunity to significantly expand
Yancoal’s operational portfolio, providing
Yancoal shareholders with exposure
to world class thermal and semi-soft
coking coal mines.
Post transaction, Yancoal will be
the largest pure-play coal producer
in Australia, with the ability to realise
ongoing value from its combined low
operating cost portfolio.
This is an exciting opportunity for
Yancoal and we look forward to continuing
to work with all stakeholders as we grow
our operations.
