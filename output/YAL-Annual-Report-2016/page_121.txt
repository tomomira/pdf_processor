D2: INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES
Accounting policies
(i) Interest bearing liabilities
Interest-bearing liabilities (excluding financial guarantees) are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs. They are
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. US dollar interest bearing loans are designated
as a hedge instrument in a cash flow hedge (refer to note D6).
(ii) Leases
Property, plant and equipment held by the Group under leases that transfer to the Group substantially all of the risks and rewards
of ownership are classified as finance leases.
The leased property, plant and equipment are initially measured at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present
value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequently they are accounted for in accordance with the property, plant and equipment
accounting policy.
The corresponding minimum lease payments are included in lease liabilities within interest bearing liabilities. Each lease payment
is allocated between finance cost and a reduction in the outstanding lease liability. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over
the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.
The net gains arising on the sale of an asset and the leasing back of the same asset using a finance lease are included as deferred
income in the balance sheet and are released to the profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
(iii) Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of assets that necessarily take a substantial
period of time to prepare for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are
substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
All other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
