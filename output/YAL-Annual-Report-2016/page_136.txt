(d) Fair value measurements
(i) Fair value hierarchy
The Group uses various methods in estimating the fair value of financial instruments. AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement
requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level in accordance with the following fair value measurement hierarchy:
(a)	 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1);
(b)	 Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices)
or indirectly (derived from prices) (level 2); and
(c)	 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) (level 3).
The following table presents the Groupâ€™s financial assets and financial liabilities measured and recognised at fair value at 31 December
2016 and 31 December 2015:
(ii) Valuation techniques
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation techniques.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available. If all significant inputs required
to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level two. If one or more of the significant inputs is not
based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. This is the case for the royalty receivable.
