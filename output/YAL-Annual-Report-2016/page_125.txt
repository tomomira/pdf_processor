objectives when managing capital are to ensure the continued
ability to provide a consistent return for equity stakeholders
through a combination of capital growth and distributions and
to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of
capital. In order to achieve these objectives, the Group seeks
to maintain a debt to debt plus equity ratio (gearing ratio) that
balances risks and returns at an acceptable level and also to
maintain a sufficient funding base to enable the Group to meet
its working capital and strategic investment needs. In order to
maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust
the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital
to shareholders, issue new shares or other equity instruments,
repay debt or draw down additional debt.
