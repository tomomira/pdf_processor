ANNUAL REPORT 2016
Yancoal will continue to
maximise blending arrangements,
operational efficiencies and
cost saving strategies to support
new market opportunities and
production rate improvements.
A key focus for the year ahead
remains the continued progression
of the Moolarben Stage Two underground
and open cut pits. At full production,
the combined Moolarben complex has
the potential to produce up to 21.0Mt
ROM coal per annum.
2017 guidance for saleable production
is 12.0Mt–12.5Mt (equity share),
excluding production from the
Middlemount joint venture and
the Watagan assets.
Forecast for 2017 capital expenditure
is around $244 million (equity share).
Further to the reporting period,
as announced 24 January 2017,
Yancoal remains focused on the
completion of the acquisition of 100
percent of the shares in Coal & Allied
Industries Limited (“Coal & Allied”)
from wholly-owned subsidiaries of
Rio Tinto Limited for US$2.45 billion
(A$3.27 billion) in completion and
deferred cash payments, plus a coal
price linked royalty.
Guidance for saleable production is also
exclusive of future potential Coal & Allied
asset tonnes.
