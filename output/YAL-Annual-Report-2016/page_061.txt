At the start of each year, KPIs and KRAs are reviewed and
selected by the Board as being the most appropriate to the
business. Assessment against these measures is determined
following the end of each year.
Performance against the STI Scorecard and the Individual KRAs
are converted to two payout multipliers, and applied to the
Target STI opportunity to determine the actual STI award.
Accordingly, the Executive’s STI award is heavily influenced by
the achievement of Company KPIs.
The assessed outcomes and average achievement for the company of 134 percent reflects the following achievements in 2016:
(a)	 The overall delivery of Profit Before Tax for the Group and the assets managed on behalf of Yancoal International Holdings (“YIH”)
of $230M ahead of budget; and
(b)	 Sizeable reductions in the key measure of FOR Cash Cost per ton across most sites; and
(c)	 The average achievement of 114 percent for each Business Unit measure;
Environment measures include environmental complaints and incidents.

respect of Profitability, Health, Safety and Environment and
Specific Business Unit measures.

opportunity by the STI Scorecard payout multiplier and the
individual performance payout multiplier. Any STI award is
delivered as a cash payment around April each year.
