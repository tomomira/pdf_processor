ANNUAL REPORT 2016
1. Ashton*
Yancoal 100%
Located in the Upper Hunter Valley region
of New South Wales, the Ashton underground mine
produces semi-soft coking coal for export through
the Port of Newcastle.
Scheduled longwall moves and challenging geological
conditions reduced cutting rates and increased change
out times throughout 2016, affecting Ashton’s overall
longwall production performance. Ashton achieved total
ROM coal production of 2.4Mt (2015 3.0Mt) and saleable
coal production of 1.1Mt (2015 1.4Mt) for the year. On 20
June 2016, the NSW Planning and Assessment Commission
(NSWPAC) granted approval for the Ashton Mod five
(integration modification), enabling the mine to increase
underground production from 3.2Mt per annum ROM to
5.0Mt per annum ROM.
The Mod five approval also allows for South East Open Cut
(“SEOC”) project coal, if developed, to be transported to and
washed through existing Ashton infrastructure. The SEOC
project is yet to be developed and has the potential to produce
up to 3.6Mt per annum of ROM coal.
2. Austar*
Yancoal 100%
Austar is one of the oldest mines within
New South Wales, having been in operation
for 100 years.
Located south west of Cessnock, Austar produces
a premium semi-hard coking coal characterised as the
highest fluidity and lowest ash coking coal in Australia,
with low phosphorous and low alkalis. The coal is shipped
through the Port of Newcastle.
Austar development coal production rates throughout
2016 were buoyed by significant improvements in longwall
production during the second half, to achieve total ROM
coal production of 1.2Mt (2015 0.8Mt) and saleable coal
production of 1.1Mt (2015 0.7Mt).
*The Watagan-controlled Ashton, Austar and Donaldson operations remain 100 percent Yancoal owned subsidiaries
