ANNUAL REPORT 2016
3. Donaldson*
Yancoal 100%
Donaldson Coal includes the Abel underground
mine and former Tasman underground mine,
located near the Port of Newcastle.
As announced 2 May 2016, the Donaldson coal operation
was moved to ‘care and maintenance’, with mining ceasing
at the Abel underground mine in June 2016. Feasibility
studies to consider potential future mining options have
commenced and the majority of Abel’s underground
employees were successfully redeployed to the neighbouring
Ashton and Austar mines. Located in the Hunter Valley,
Donaldson’s underground Abel mine previously produced
thermal and semi-soft coking coal for blending, exporting
via the Port of Newcastle. Rehabilitation of the former
Tasman mine was successfully completed in 2014.
The Abel underground mine produced a total 0.3Mt of ROM
coal (2015 1.8Mt) and 0.2Mt (2015 1.3Mt) of saleable coal for
the reporting period, in accordance with expectations.
4. Middlemount
Yancoal ~50%
A Joint Venture between Peabody Energy
and Yancoal, the Middlemount mine produces low
volatile pulverised coal injection (PCI) coal and
hard coking coal, with contracted rail and port
capacity through Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal
and Abbot Point Port.
The Middlemount joint venture maintained steady
production rates throughout 2016, overcoming wet weather
impacts in the first half of the year, to produce total annual
ROM coal production of 5.3Mt (2015 5.5Mt) and total
saleable coal production of 4.1Mt (2015 4.0Mt).
Middlemount mine is an open cut mine located 90km
north east of Emerald in Queensland’s Bowen Basin.
Full scale operations at the open-cut mine commenced in
November 2011, with mining activities using conventional
truck and shovel techniques with ROM coal washed at an
onsite facility with a capacity of about 5.3Mt per annum.
