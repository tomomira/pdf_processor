B4: EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
Accounting Policies
(i) Employee benefits expenses
Employee benefits are expensed as the related service by the employee is provided and includes both equity and cash based
payment transactions. Employee benefits recognised in the profit or loss are net of recoveries.
(ii) Superannuation
Contributions made by the Group to defined contribution superannuation funds are recognised as an expense in the period
in which they are incurred.
(iii) Wages and salaries, annual leave and sick leave
Liabilities for employee benefits for wages, salaries, annual leave and accumulating sick leave that are expected to be wholly settled
within 12 months of the reporting date represent present obligations resulting from employeesâ€™ services provided to the reporting
date and are calculated at undiscounted amounts based on wage and salary rates that the Group expects to pay as at the reporting
date including related on costs, such as superannuation, workers compensation, insurance and payroll tax and are included in trade
and other payables. Non-accumulating, non-monetary benefits such as housing and cars are expensed by the Group as the benefits
are used by the employee.
Employee benefits payable later than 12 months have been measured at the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be
made for those benefits. In determining the liability, consideration is given to employee salary and wage increases and the probability
that the employee may satisfy any vesting requirements. Those cash flows are discounted using government bonds with terms to maturity
that match the expected timing of cash flows attributable to employee benefits. These employee benefits are presented as current
provisions as the Group has no unconditional right to deferred settlement for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period.
(a) Employee benefits expense
During 2016 $26.0 million of employee benefits were capitalised (2015: $45.4 million)
