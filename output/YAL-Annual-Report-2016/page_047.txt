ANNUAL REPORT 2016
2 All “Yancoal-controlled” production includes Ashton, Austar and Donaldson coal prior to 31 March.
The Moolarben Complex (Yancoal 81 percent ownership)
achieved total ROM production of 12.2Mt ROM (2015 9.0Mt)
and saleable coal production of 9.3Mt (2015 6.9Mt).
The continued ramp up in Moolarben’s open cut production
from the opening of the Mod 9 mining area and establishing
of new throughput efficiencies in the first half of the year.
Construction of the Moolarben Stage Two underground
mine continued in accordance with project targets, with
first development coal from the new Stage Two underground
commencing in April and extraction of the Stage Two open
cut box cut occurring in July.
Ongoing geological challenges within the Stratford Duralie
open cut mining area affected production performance
throughout the year, resulting in significantly reduced
production rates in the second half of the year as the operation
commenced a redesign of the mine plan and adjustment of
operating conditions. The interruptions to mining resulting
in total ROM coal production of 1.2Mt (2015 1.9Mt) and saleable
coal production of 0.9Mt (2015 1.4Mt) for the reporting period.
Queensland
Yarrabee (Yancoal 100 percent ownership) maintained
consistently strong production rates throughout the reporting
period, overcoming detrimental wet weather impacts and
flooding conditions in the first quarter of the year, to deliver
above targets with a total ROM coal production of 3.6Mt (2015
3.4Mt) and total saleable coal production of 3.1Mt (2015 2.8Mt).
Yarrabee’s increased production output in the second half of
the year benefitted from positive changes made to existing shift
arrangements, supported by established fleet and Coal Handling
and Processing Plant efficiencies introduced in the year prior.
The Middlemount joint venture (Yancoal ~50 percent
ownership) maintained steady production rates throughout
2016, overcoming similar wet weather impacts experienced
at Yancoal’s Yarrabee operation, to produce total annual ROM
coal production of 5.3Mt (2015 5.5Mt) and total saleable coal
production of 4.1Mt (2015 4.1Mt).
Watagan-controlled3
Ashton (Yancoal 100 percent ownership3) achieved total
ROM coal production of 2.4Mt (2015 3.0Mt) and saleable
coal production of 1.1Mt (2015 1.4Mt) for the year.
On 20 June 2016, the NSW Planning and Assessment
Commission (PAC) granted approval for the Ashton Mod five
(integration modification). The modification enables Ashton
to increase underground production from 2.95Mt per annum
ROM to 5.0Mt per annum ROM and contemporise the
conditions of the existing Ashton coal mine.
Austar (Yancoal 100 percent ownership3) development coal
production rates throughout 2016 were buoyed by significant
improvements in longwall production during the second half,
to achieve total ROM coal production of 1.2Mt (2015 0.8Mt)
and saleable coal production of 1.1Mt (2015 0.7Mt).
Production gains achieved in the second half offset an
unscheduled shutdown of the longwall in August, following
a small coal burst in the main working area.
The Donaldson (Yancoal 100 percent ownership3) operation’s
Abel underground mine produced a total 0.3Mt of ROM coal
(2015 1.8Mt) and 0.2Mt (2015 1.3Mt) of saleable coal for the
reporting period, in accordance with expectations. As announced
2 May 2016, the Donaldson coal operation was moved to ‘care
and maintenance’, with mining ceasing at the Abel underground
mine in June 2016 and commencing new feasibility studies.
Infrastructure
Newcastle Infrastructure Group (“NCIG”) Coal Terminal
(Yancoal 27 percent)
Yancoal continues to be one of five company shareholders
involved in the $2.5 billion NCIG export coal terminal
in Newcastle, New South Wales. Yancoal has a 27 percent
ownership with an allocation of approximately 14.6Mt
per annum (100 percent basis).
The Moolarben Coal mine is the largest of Yancoal’s Hunter
based mines to use the terminal.
