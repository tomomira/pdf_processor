D8: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)
(b) Credit risk
Credit risk is managed on a Group basis. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, favourable derivative financial
instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to wholesale and retail customers,
including outstanding receivables and committed transactions. For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated
parties with a minimum rating of ‘A’ are accepted. If wholesale customers are independently rated, these ratings are used.
Otherwise, if there is no independent rating, the marketing department assesses the credit quality of the customer, taking
into account its financial position, past experience and other factors.
Credit risk in trade receivables is managed in the following ways:
(i)	 Payment terms and credit limits are set for individual customers;
(ii)	 A risk assessment process is used for all customers; and
(iii)	Letters of credit are required for those customers assessed as posing a higher risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk on financial assets which have been recognised in the balance sheet is their carrying
amount less impairment provision, if any as set out below.
