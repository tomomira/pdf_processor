B2: REVENUE (CONTINUED)
(ii) Interest
Interest income from a financial asset is accrued on a time
basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the
effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly
discounts the estimated future cash receipts through the
expected life of the financial asset to that assetâ€™s net carrying
amount. Interest income from a finance lease is recognised over
the term of the lease based on a pattern reflecting a constant
periodic rate of return on the net investment in the lease.
(iii) Services
Revenue from the rendering of a service is recognised upon
the delivery of the service to the customer.
(iv) Other
Other primarily consists of dividends, rents, sub-lease rental
and management fees. Dividends are recognised as revenue when
the right to receive payment is established. Rental income arising
on land surrounding a mine site is accounted for on a straight-line
basis over the lease term. Contingent rental income is recognised
as income in the periods in which it is earned.
