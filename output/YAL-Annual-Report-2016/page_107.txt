B7: LOSS PER SHARE
Accounting policies
(a) Basic loss per share
Calculated as net profit attributable to members of the parent, adjusted to exclude any costs of servicing equity (other than dividends)
and preference shares dividends, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares, adjusted for any bonus element.
(b) Diluted loss per share
Calculated as net loss attributable to members of the parent, adjusted for costs of servicing equity (other than dividends); the after-tax
effect of dividends and interest associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares that have been recognised as expenses; and other
non-discretionary changes in revenues or expenses during the period that would result from the dilution of potential ordinary shares,
divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares and dilutive potential ordinary shares, adjusted for any bonus element.
The potential conversion of subordinated capital notes into ordinary shares has an anti-dilutive impact as the Group is loss making
and is therefore excluded from the weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of diluted loss per share. On 31
December 2016 a noteholder converted 60 SCN’s into 60,000 ordinary shares of the Company. At 31 December 2016 there are
18,005,042 SCNs on issue. Each note is convertible into 1,000 ordinary shares at the option of the holder up to 31 December 2044.
