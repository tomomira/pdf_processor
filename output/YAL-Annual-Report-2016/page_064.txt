ANNUAL REPORT 2016
Directors’ Report
5. NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FEES
Objective
The Board seeks to set remuneration for Non-Executive
Directors at a level which:
•	 Provides the Company with the ability to attract and retain
directors of the highest calibre;
•	 Reflects the responsibilities and demands made
on Non-Executive Directors; and
•	 Is reasonable and acceptable to the Company’s shareholders.
Structure
The remuneration structure for the Non-Executive Directors
is distinct from the remuneration structure for Executives
in line with sound corporate governance.
The Company set an aggregate remuneration cap of $3,500,000
per annum for all Non-Executive Directors. Consistent with
the Constitution, remuneration payable to each Non-Executive
Director has been approved by the Company’s majority
shareholder, Yanzhou.
A Not paid to Yanzhou appointed Co-Vice Chairman.
The total Board and Committee fees paid by the Company to
Non-Executive Directors in 2016, excluding payments for extra
services outlined below, was $647,652 which is $2,852,348 below
the current aggregate cap of $3,500,000 per annum.
During 2016, Non-Executive Directors were remunerated by
way of fixed fees in the form of cash and superannuation (to the
maximum superannuation guarantee cap). There has been no
change to the Board and Committee fees from 2015 to 2016.
No equity instruments were issued to Non-Executive Directors
over 2016 and no element of the Non-Executive Director fees
are linked to performance.
Neither Board nor Committee fees were paid to nominee Directors
of Yanzhou (Xiyong Li, Cunliang Lai, Yuxiang Wu, Fuqi Wang
and Baocai Zhang) as the responsibilities of Board or Committee
membership were considered part of their role and remuneration
arrangements with their nominating company. William Randall
is not paid any Board or Committee fees.
Neither Board nor Committee fees were paid to Executive
Directors (Baocai Zhang or Boyun Xu) as the responsibilities
of Committee membership are considered in determining
the remuneration provided as part of their normal
employment conditions.
