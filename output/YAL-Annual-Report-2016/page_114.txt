Accounting policies
(i) Goodwill
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is recognised at cost and subsequently measured at cost less any impairment losses.
The cost represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and
contingent liabilities acquired. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances
indicate that it might be impaired. See Note C3 for further details on impairment of assets.
(ii) Computer software
Computer software is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation
is calculated on a straight-line basis over the period of expected benefit, which ranges from 2.5 to 10 years.
(iii) Access rights and other mining licences
Access rights and other mining licences have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation
and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is calculated as the shorter of the life of the mine or agreement using
a units of production basis in tonnes, or on a straight-line basis. The estimated useful lives vary from 10 to 25 years.
