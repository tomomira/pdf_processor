ANNUAL REPORT 2016
Port Waratah Coal Services
(“PWCS”)
Yancoal has take-or-pay contracts
with PWCS for the export of coal
through the terminals at Newcastle,
with a port allocation of approximately
11.9Mt (100 percent basis).
Wiggins Island Coal Export
Terminal (“WICET”)
(Yancoal 7.5 percent)
Yancoal is one of five owners of WICET,
which has a capacity of 27.0Mt per
annum. Yancoal’s contracted capacity
is 1.5Mt per annum, allocated to the
Yarrabee Mine.
RAIL
Yancoal is supported by the following rail
networks to transport product from mine
to port:
•	 The NSW Hunter Valley Coal Chain
supports the Moolarben, Austar,
Ashton, Stratford Duralie, and
Donaldson operations, with coal
transported to the Port of Newcastle;
•	 The QLD Blackwater System supports
the Yarrabee operation, transporting
coal to the Port of Gladstone;
•	 The QLD Goonyella System supports
the Middlemount operation, with coal
transported to the Port of Hay Point
and Abbot Point Coal Terminal.
TAKE-OR-PAY
The Yancoal logistics team has a target
of reducing take-or-pay exposure across
the group by trading between sites and
with other users. Longer term, Yancoal’s
planned Moolarben Stage Two expansion
will significantly rebalance the mine and
logistics equation.
For 2016, Yancoal had take-or-pay rail
and port commitments in excess of
planned sales with a $74 million potential
order of magnitude take-or-pay exposure.
