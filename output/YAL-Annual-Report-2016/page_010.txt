ANNUAL REPORT 2016
At the same time we have forged ahead
with the development of our tier one
Moolarben Coal Complex, successfully
completing the construction of the
new underground mine on time and on
budget. Our expansion of the Moolarben
asset sends a strong signal to both the
market and local resources sector of our
long-term vision and commitment to
continued investment within Australia.
Benefitting from continued operational
efficiencies and improved metallurgical
and thermal coal prices in the second
half of the year, Yancoal achieved
a total Operating EBIT for 2016 of
$52.3 million before tax, up $253.1
million on the year prior.
Throughout 2016 Yancoal
responded to market conditions
and the constraints of its
operating cash flow with strong
and decisive action. Instituting
new debt-funding arrangements
to support the underground
operations and providing our
business with the optionality
required to assist future organic
and acquisitive growth.
As we experience the first signs of sustainable positive
improvements within the thermal and metallurgical
coal markets, Yancoal continues to prove itself a leader
in production, transparency and investment.
Our loss after income tax for 2016
of $227.1 million was also a significant
improvement on the year prior
(31 December 2015: $291.2 million)
and a credit to the actions taken by
our Executive and operational teams
to continuously drive positive balance
sheet improvements.
At the commencement of 2016,
Yancoal instituted a necessary
debt-funding arrangement to secure
up to US$775 million to date, via the
issuing of nine-year secured debt bonds
by a newly established Yancoal subsidiary,
Watagan Mining Company Pty Ltd
(“Watagan”), to Industrial Bank Co., Ltd,
BOCI Financial Products Limited and
United NSW Energy Limited.
The debt-funding arrangement provided
additional funding to support the future
of the underground assets of Ashton,
Austar and Donaldson, with control
of the underground assets subsequently
transferring to Watagan.
