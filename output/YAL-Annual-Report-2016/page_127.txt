D6: HEDGE RESERVE
Accounting policy
When a financial instrument is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of
the hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging reserve until the anticipated
underlying transaction occurs. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised
immediately in profit or loss.
If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, or is sold, terminated or expires, any accumulated
gain or loss remains in equity until the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. If the forecast transaction
is no longer expected to occur, then the amount accumulated in equity is immediately recognised in profit or loss.
The collar option contracts entered into by the Group are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges.
The hedging reserve is used to record gains or losses on cash flow hedges that are recognised directly in equity through
the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income.
The closing balance relates to the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of the natural cash flow hedge
using the US dollar denominated interest-bearing liabilities to hedge against future coal sales.
During the year ended 31 December 2016, losses of $133.3 million were transferred from other comprehensive income to profit
or loss in respect of hedging reserve. During the year ended 31 December 2015 a loss of $22.3 million on foreign exchange contracts
was transferred from other comprehensive income to profit or loss.
