ANNUAL REPORT 2016
Operating performance
Fleet and mine plan efficiencies
at Yancoalâ€™s Moolarben and Yarrabee
open cut mines drove strong production
throughout the reporting period, with
the Group achieving total ROM coal
production of 26.2Mt (21.2Mt equity
share) and saleable coal production
of 19.8Mt (16.0Mt equity share).
Yancoal continued to restructure
its operations throughout 2016,
reducing costs and maximising
blending across the New South
Wales sites.
Financial performance
Yancoal announced a loss after income
tax of $227.1 million from revenue
of $1.24 billion for the full year ended
31 December 2016.
Sales volume increases, global coal
market price improvements and 2016
industry-high quarterly benchmark prices
for semi-soft coking and PCI coal during
the second half of the year drove a total
Operating EBIT of $52.3 million before
tax, up $253.1 million on the year prior.
Yancoal responded to sustained low coal
price impacts and existing operating cash
flow constraints in the first half of the
year via a debt funding arrangement and
transfer of control of the Austar, Ashton
and Donaldson underground operations
to a newly established Yancoal subsidiary,
Watagan, as announced 17 February 2016.
We continue to demonstrate
our capacity and resilience
within a challenging market
via strong and decisive actions
to grow our business and
reduce operating costs.
