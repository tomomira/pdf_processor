C7: TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES
Accounting policy
Trade and other receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
market. They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the reporting period which
are classified as non-current assets. After initial recognition, trade and other receivables are carried at amortised cost using the
effective interest method.
(i)	 Other receivables includes a stamp duty refund receivable of $9.2 million (2015: $14.2 million). The stamp duty refund
receivable is subject to ongoing discussions with the New South Wales Office of State Revenue and management expect
that this amount will be refunded within the next 12 months.
(ii)	 Promissory notes to the value of $674.3 million were issued to the Group by Yanzhou Coal Mining Company Limited
on 22 June 2012 on the disposal of certain mining assets, including promissory notes of $21.2 million with regard
to the expected tax on the disposal. Management believe that this will be settled within the next 12 months.
(iii) Receivables from joint venture includes a loan provided to Middlemount Coal Pty Ltd (“Middlemount”) with a face
value of $349.9 million. From 1 July 2015 the shareholders of Middlemount agreed to make the loan interest free for
18 months. At 31 December 2016 this loan was further extended on an interest free basis for two months and has been
revalued using the effective interest rate method to $346.8 million with the difference being recognised as a contribution
to the joint venture.
(iv) Receivables from other entities represent the Group’s investment in securities issued by Wiggins Island Coal Export
Terminal Pty Ltd (‘WICET’). These include E Class Wiggins Island Preference Securities (‘WIPS’) of $28.4 million
(2015: $15.3 million) and Gladstone Long Term Securities (‘GiLTS’) of $31.5 million (2015: $31.5 million).
