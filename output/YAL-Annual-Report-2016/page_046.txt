ANNUAL REPORT 2016
Directors’ Report
Corporate activities
On 17 February, Yancoal announced a new financing
arrangement to secure up to US$950 million in debt-funding
via the issuing of nine-year secured debt bonds by newly
established Yancoal subsidiary Watagan, to Industrial Bank
Co., Ltd, BOCI Financial Products Limited (“BOCI”) and United
NSW Energy Limited. The subsidiaries of Watagan include
the three NSW underground coal mining operations of Ashton,
Austar and Donaldson.
On and from financial close of the arrangement, effective 31
March, Yancoal ceased to control Watagan and its subsidiaries,
including the NSW underground assets of Austar, Ashton and
Donaldson. Yancoal will provide mine management, marketing,
infrastructure and other corporate support services for the
Watagan mines under 10-year contracts.
As part of the arrangement for the subscription and issue of the
secured debt bonds, and as announced 1 April 2016, BOCI was
to subscribe for the remaining US$175 million of BOCI’s total
proposed subscription of US$375 million by 30 September 2016.
However, all parties agreed to extend BOCI’s subscription date
in respect of that US$175 million amount to 31 March 2017.
The Ashton, Austar and Donaldson mines are managed
by Yancoal Mining Services Pty Ltd (“YMS”), a fully-owned
Yancoal subsidiary and employing entity for all eastern
region underground operations staff, established during
the reporting period.
On 2 March 2016, Yancoal announced the Donaldson operation
was to move to ‘care and maintenance’ during the first half
of the year, following the cessation of mining activities and
the commencement of new feasibility studies. Mining ceased
at Donaldson’s Abel underground mine on 6 June 2016.
Mining operations
(all figures reported on a 100 percent basis)
In NSW, Yancoal continued to operate the Moolarben and
Stratford Duralie open cut mines throughout the reporting
period, with control of the underground mines of Austar, Ashton
and Donaldson transferring to Watagan from 31 March 2016.
Yancoal continued to manage the assets on behalf of Watagan
throughout the reporting period.
In Queensland, Yancoal operated the Yarrabee open cut
operation and maintained its near 50 percent equity interest
in Middlemount Coal Pty Ltd (“Middlemount”) throughout
the reporting period.
Fleet and mine plan efficiencies at Yancoal’s Moolarben and
Yarrabee open cut mines drove strong production throughout
the reporting period, with the Group achieving total Run of Mine
(“ROM”) coal production of 26.2 million tonnes (“Mt”) (21.2Mt
equity share) for the year (31 December 2015: 20.8Mt equity
share) and saleable coal production of 19.8Mt (16.0Mt equity
share) for the year (31 December 2015: 15.2Mt equity share).
2016’s total production result was above the previously
published operational guidance of 13.0Mt saleable coal (equity
share), as Yancoal responded to increased market demand and
global coal market price improvements during the second half
of the year.
Total coal sales (equity share) were 19.3Mt for the year
(31 December 2015: 17.8Mt).
Yancoal’s sales split (equity share) for the period was 11.6Mt
(2015 10.2Mt) thermal and 7.7Mt (2015 7.6Mt) metallurgical coal.
Yancoal continued to manage the Cameby Downs and
Premier coal mining operations in Queensland and Western
Australia respectively, on behalf of its majority shareholder
Yanzhou Coal Mining Company Limited (“Yanzhou”)
throughout the reporting period.
New South Wales
NSW operations achieved total ROM coal production
of 17.3Mt (2015 16.5Mt) (Yancoal-controlled2 13.4Mt,
Watagan-controlled2 3.9Mt) and saleable coal production
of 12.6Mt (2015 11.8Mt) (Yancoal-controlled 10.2Mt,
Watagan-controlled 2.4Mt) for the period.
Consistently strong production gains at Moolarben’s open
cut operation as a result of established fleet and mine plan
efficiencies, helped offset a slow-down in production at the
Stratford Duralie open cut.
