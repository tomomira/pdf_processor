ANNUAL REPORT 2016
With market prices having improved
significantly in the second half of the
year, Yancoal was well prepared to
rapidly respond to new marketing and
sales opportunities.
Our operations ramping up where
required to meet customer demand and
maximising blending opportunities across
our NSW sites to make the most of sales in
both established and emerging markets.
At a project level, development of the
Moolarben Stage Two project achieved
a series of critical milestones throughout
the year on time and on budget.
The new Moolarben underground
commenced producing development coal
in April and remains on target for the ramp
up to full longwall production in late 2017.
These significant achievements
demonstrate the capabilities
and experience of our operational
and project teams as they work
together to forge the next stage
in Yancoal’s expansion.
Yancoal’s operations overcame tough market
and operating conditions in the first half of 2016,
to finish the year with a robust result driven
by mine site improvements and the continued
success of our tier one Moolarben complex.
