venture of the Group confirming:
•	 It will not demand the repayment of any loan due from
Middlemount, except to the extent that Middlemount
agrees otherwise or as otherwise provided in the loan

(iv) Other contingencies
A number of claims have been made against the Group, including
in respect of personal injuries, and in relation to contracts which
Group members are party to as part of the Group’s day to day
operations. The personal injury claims which have been made
against the Group have largely been assumed by the insurers of
the Group under the Group’s insurance policies. The Directors do
not believe that the outcome of these claims will have a material
impact on the Group’s financial position.
