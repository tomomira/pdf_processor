ANNUAL REPORT 2016
5. Moolarben
Yancoal 81%
Located within the Western Coalfields of
New South Wales, the Moolarben coal mine
is a world-class open cut coal asset producing
export quality thermal coal.
The Moolarben Complex achieved total ROM
production of 12.2Mt (2015 9.0Mt) and saleable coal
production of 9.4Mt (2015 6.9Mt). The continued
ramp up in Moolarbenâ€™s open cut production,
supported by recent CHPP throughput efficiencies.
Construction of the Moolarben Stage Two
underground mine continued in accordance with
project targets, with first development coal from
the new underground mine commencing in April
and extraction of the Stage Two open cut box
cut occurring in July. Once fully developed, the
integrated Moolarben Coal Complex (Stage One
and Stage Two) has approval to produce up to 21Mt
of ROM coal per annum for a period of 24 years.
Moolarben Coal Operations Pty Ltd is the operator
of the Moolarben Coal Complex on behalf of the
Joint Venture (JV). The JV partners are Moolarben
Coal Mines Pty Ltd (81 percent), a consortium of
Korean companies represented by Kores Australia
Moolarben Coal Pty Ltd (nine percent), and Sojitz
Moolarben Resources Pty Ltd (10 percent).
6. Stratford   Duralie
Yancoal 100%
Located within the New South Wales
Gloucester Basin, the Stratford Duralie
operation produces high fluidity semi-soft
coking and thermal coals.
Ongoing geological challenges within the Stratford
Duralie open cut mining area affected production
performance throughout the year, resulting in
a redesign of the mine plan and adjustments to
operating conditions in the second half.
The interruptions to mining resulted in total ROM
coal production of 1.2Mt (2015 1.9Mt) and saleable
coal production of 0.9Mt (2015 1.4Mt) for the
reporting period.
The proposed Stratford extension project has
the potential to extract up to 21.5Mt of ROM
coal over 11 years at a rate of up to 2.6Mt per annum.
Development of the project is subject to market
conditions. Production at the Stratford open cut
Bowen Road North Pit ceased in July 2014.
Duralie coal continues to be processed at the
Stratford Coal Handling and Preparation Plant.
