3. EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION
The Executive remuneration structure below is an appropriate
reflection of Yanzhou’s majority shareholding in the Company.
3.1 Objective
Remuneration frameworks for Executives are structured
to be market competitive and to reflect the reward strategy
of the organisation. Through these frameworks the Company
seeks to align remuneration for Executives with:
Shareholders' interests by:
•	 Making economic performance a core component of the overall
remuneration plan design;
•	 Focusing on the key value drivers of the business including
employee safety, operational performance and cost control; and
•	 Attracting and retaining high calibre executives.
3.3 Remuneration mix
The relative proportion of remuneration entitlement for Executives that is fixed (excluding benefits) and that which is linked
to individual or Company performance or both (referred to as ‘at risk’) is as follows:
Boyun Xu is an Executive Director of Yancoal, however his executive role relates to Yancoal International (Holding) Co., Ltd (“YIH”). Mr Xu’s remuneration is paid for by YIH
and as such he is not considered a senior executive of Yancoal.
A Calculations for fixed remuneration entitlement exclude the value of benefits, see table 3 and table 11;
B The short term variable remuneration entitlement is determined pursuant to the Short Term Incentive Plan (outlined in section 3.5.1);
C The Special Incentive Scheme is outlined in section 3.5.2;
D The Long Term Incentive Plan is outlined in section 3.5.3.
Executive’s interests by:
•	 Rewarding capability and experience;
•	 Reflecting competitive reward for contribution to growth
in company performance;
•	 Providing a clear structure for earning rewards; and
•	 Providing recognition for contribution.
Details of remuneration for all Executives are set out in Table 11
(See Section 6: Remuneration tables).
