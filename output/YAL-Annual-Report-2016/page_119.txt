Provision
Description
Employee benefits
The provision for employee benefits represents long service leave and annual leave entitlements and other
incentives accrued by employees.
Rehabilitation costs
Mining lease agreements and exploration permits impose obligations on the Group to rehabilitate areas
where mining activity has taken place. Rehabilitation of these areas is ongoing and in some cases will contin-
ue until 2041. The provision for rehabilitation costs has been calculation based on the present value of the
future costs expected to be incurred in restoring affected mining areas, assuming current technologies.
Key estimate and judgement:
The rehabilitation provision has been created based on managements’ internal estimates and assumptions
relating to the current economic environment, which management believes is a reasonable basis upon which
to estimate the future liability.
These estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions,
however actual rehabilitation costs will ultimately depend upon the future market prices for the necessary
decommissioning works and the timing of when the rehabilitation costs are incurred. Timing is dependent
upon when the mines ceases to produce at economically viable rates, which in turn, will depend upon future
coal prices, which are inherently uncertain.
Take-or-pay
In acquiring part of a business or operation, an assessment is made on the fair value of the assets
and liabilities under AASB 3 Business Combinations. Take-or-pay is the assessment of forecast excess
capacity for port and rail contracts. A provision was recognised for the discounted estimated excess
capacity. The provision has a finite life and will be released to profit or loss over the period in which
excess capacity is realised.
Key estimate and judgement:
The provision is recognised and estimated based on management’s assessment of contracted port capacity
versus forecast usage. This involves making assumptions about the probability, amount and timing of an
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits.
Other provisions
The provision includes marketing services fee payable to Noble Group Limited deemed above market norms
and make good provisions to cover the cost to ‘make good’ any hired equipment, in case any major overhaul
costs are incurred at the end of the lease period.
