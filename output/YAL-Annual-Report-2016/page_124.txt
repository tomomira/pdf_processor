D3: DERIVATIVES
Accounting policy
The Group is party to derivative financial instruments (including forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange
collar option contracts) in the normal course of business in order to hedge exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange
rates in accordance with the Groupâ€™s financial risk management policies (refer to Note D6). Foreign currency speculation
is specifically excluded.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting
period. Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives, except those that qualify as effective hedges,
are immediately recognised in profit or loss.
For the accounting policy relating to derivatives used in cash flow hedges refer to D6.
