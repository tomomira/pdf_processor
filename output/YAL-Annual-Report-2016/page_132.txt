(ii) Price risk
The price risk of the Group include coal price risk. The Group does not enter into commodity contracts other than to meet the
Group’s expected usage and sales requirements, such contracts are not settled net. The royalty receivables from Middlemount JV
is exposed to fluctuations in coal price. The Group currently does not have any derivative hedges in place against the movement in
the spot coal price.
Sensitivity
The following table summarises the sensitivity of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities to a possible change in the forecasted
coal sales price used to determine the fair value of the royalty receivable from the Middlemount Joint Venture. A 10 percent
(decrease)/increase in the market price would have (decreased)/increased equity and profit or loss after tax by the amounts
shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.
(iii) Interest rate risk
The Group is subject to interest rate risk that arises from borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash. Generally,
no variable interest is receivable or payable on the Group’s trade and other receivables or payables where applicable as they are fixed
in nature and therefore they are not exposed to the interest rate risk. The Group’s cash flow interest rate risk for assets primarily
arises from cash at bank and deposits subject to market bank rates. Floating rate borrowings bearing LIBOR rates are re-set
on a quarterly basis. The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk and the weighted average interest rate is set out as below:
