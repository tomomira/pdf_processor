D8: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)
(a) Market risk (continued)
Once the anticipated underlying transaction occurs, amounts accumulated in equity are recycled through the profit or loss or
recognised as part of the cost of the asset to which it relates. The ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are
designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised immediately in the profit or loss. In the current period, the loss relating to
the ineffective portion was $nil (2015: nil).
Natural cash flow hedge
The Group currently does not use bank issued instruments to hedge foreign exchange risks in respect of US dollar denominated loans,
however, the scheduled repayment of the principal on US dollar loans is designated to hedge the cash flow risks on the portion of
forecast US dollar sales that are not hedged through bank issued instruments (“natural cash flow hedge”). US dollar loan repayments
up to a six-month period are designated to hedge the forecast US dollar sales during the same period after the designation of the hedge
relationship based on a dollar for dollar basis until the hedge ratio reaches one.
Hedging effectiveness is determined by comparing the changes in the hedging instruments and hedged sales. Hedge ineffectiveness
will occur when cash flows generated by sales transactions are lower than the forecast sales transaction. In cases of hedge
ineffectiveness, gains or losses in relation to the excess portion in the foreign exchange movement of the designated US dollar loan
repayment will be recycled to profit or loss. The effective portion of changes in the hedging instruments will be recognised in the cash
flow hedge reserve in Other Comprehensive Income. When the sales transactions occur, amounts accumulated in equity are recycled
through the profit or loss as an increase or decrease to sales revenue.
Royalty receivable
The royalty receivable from the Middlemount Joint Venture is estimated based on expected future cash flows that are dependent
on sales volumes, US dollar denominated coal prices and the US dollar foreign exchange rate (refer to Note C9).
The Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk at the end of the reporting period, expressed in Australian dollars, was as follows:
