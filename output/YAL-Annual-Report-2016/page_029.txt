ANNUAL REPORT 2016
7. Yarrabee
Yancoal 100%
Yarrabee produces ultra-low volatile, semi-anthracite
PCI coal, exporting to steelmakers in the Asian region
via the Port of Gladstone.
Yarrabee maintained consistently strong production rates
throughout the reporting period, overcoming detrimental wet
weather impacts and flooding conditions in the first half of
the year, to deliver total ROM of 3.6Mt (2015 3.4Mt) and total
saleable coal production of 3.1Mt (2015 2.8Mt).
Yarrabee’s increased production output in the second half
of the year benefitted from positive changes to existing
shift arrangements, supported by established fleet and Coal
Handling and Processing Plant efficiencies introduced in
the year prior. Acquired in December 2009, the Yarrabee
open cut coal mine is located approximately 40km north
east of Blackwater in Central Queensland’s Bowen Basin.
