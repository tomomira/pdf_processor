Sensitivity
The following table summarises the sensitivity of the Groupâ€™s significant financial assets and liabilities to changes in variable
interest rates. This sensitivity is based on reasonably possible changes, determined using observed historical interest rate
movements for the preceding five year period, with a heavier weighting given to more recent market data. Past movements are
not necessarily indicative of future movements. For financial assets, a 25 basis point (decrease)/increase in interest rates would
have (decreased)/increased equity and profit or loss after tax by the amounts shown below. For financial liabilities, a 25 basis
point (decrease)/increase in interest rates would have increased/(decreased) equity and profit or loss after tax by the amounts
shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.
