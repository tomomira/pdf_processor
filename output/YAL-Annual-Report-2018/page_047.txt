Other income increased from $4 million in 2017 to $68 million in 2018, primarily due to a net gain on foreign exchange of $61 million (2017:
net loss of $8 million included in Other operating expenses) primarily due to exchange gains recognised on holding US$ cash balances as the
Australian dollar weakened during the year.
Changes in inventories of finished goods and work in progress
Changes in inventories of finished goods and work in progress decreased from $31 million in 2017 to $7 million in 2018.

(1)	 Ex-mine sales tonnes includes (i) 81% of the Moolarben unincorporated joint venture up to and including 30 November 2018 and 85% thereafter; (ii) 67.6% of the unincorporated
HVO joint venture up to and including 3 May 2018 and 51% thereafter; (iii) 64.1% of the unincorporated MTW joint venture up to and including 28 February 2018 and

Raw materials and consumables used
Raw materials and consumables used increased by 92% from $349 million in 2017 to $669 million in 2018, primarily due to the impact of the
C&A Acquisition and the Moolarben expansion that contributed to a 78% increase in saleable production. In addition, diesel costs increased
by 123%, primarily due to increased market prices for diesel fuel and larger truck fleets at the acquired C&A mines. This contributed to an
increase in per ex-mine sales tonne raw materials and consumables used from $18 to $20 over the same period.
Employee benefits
Employee benefits expenses increased by 72% from $302 million in 2017 to $518 million in 2018, primarily due to the increase in overall
headcount as a result of the C&A Acquisition and the Moolarben expansion. Per ex-mine sales tonne employee benefits expenses remained
flat at $16 over the same period.
Transportation
Transportation costs increased by 72% from $312 million in 2017 to $537 million in 2018, primarily due to increased sales volume of
coal requiring additional payments for rail and freight services. Per ex-mine sales tonne transportation costs remained flat at $16 over the
same period.
Contractual services and plant hire
Contractual services and plant hire expenses increased by 61% from $241 million in 2017 to $389 million in 2018, primarily due to the C&A
Acquisition, although the level of contractors has been reduced during the year at these sites. This contributed to a decrease in per ex-mine
sales tonne contractual services and plant hire from $12 to $11 over the same period.
