(b) Other segment information
(i) Segment revenue
Sales between segments are carried out at arm’s length and are eliminated on consolidation. The revenues from external parties for the reportable
segments are measured in a manner consistent with that in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss or Other Comprehensive Income.
Revenues from external customers are derived from the sale of coal from operating mines and coal purchases. Segment revenues are allocated
based on the country in which the customer is located. Refer to Note B2 for revenue from external customers split by geographical region.
Revenues from the top five external customers were $1,644 million (2017: $813 million) which in aggregate represent approximately 35%
(2017: 31%) of the Group’s revenues from the sale of coal. These revenues were attributable to the NSW and QLD coal mining segments.
