RELATIONSHIP WITH CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDERS
As at the date of this Report:
a)	 Yankuang is, directly and indirectly, interested in approximately
52.86% of the shares in Yanzhou and Yanzhou is interested in
approximately 62.26% of the Shares in the Company;

and Yanzhou; and
c)	 Yankuang and Yanzhou are controlling shareholders of the
Company (Controlling Shareholders).
Operational Independence
The Yankuang Group does not have any interests in mines in Australia
other than through its interests in the Yanzhou Group and the Group.
The mining assets of Yanzhou located in Australia, other than through
its interest in the Group, are managed and operated by the Company.
These mining assets of Yanzhou comprise (i) the Cameby Downs
mine located in Queensland, Australia, (ii) the Premier mine located
in Western Australia (the “Managed Mines”), and (iii) exploration
projects not currently in production. Pursuant to a long-term
management services agreement, the Company is responsible for,
among others, HR, treasury and the operations, exploration and
development of the Managed Mines.
The Directors are of the view that the connected transaction
entered into with the Yanzhou Group as described above will
not have any material impact on the Group’s ability to operate
independently and the Group’s operations are independent from
the Controlling Shareholders.
Financial Independence
As at 31 December 2018, except for the guarantee provided by
Yankuang in respect of the obligations of Watagan (a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company) under a loan facility agreement between
the Company and Watagan, of which A$835 million remained drawn
down, there are no loans or guarantees which are provided by the
Yankuang Group to or for the benefit of the Group.
Since 31 December 2018, the Company has not drawn down or
utilised any of the loan facilities or guarantees mentioned above
and has no intention to further draw down on such loan facilities
or guarantees before the Listing.
The Group has obtained financing from third party sources on a
stand-alone basis without any credit support from the Yanzhou Group
or the Yankuang Group or any of their respective associates. The
Directors are therefore of the view that the Group is able to operate
financially independently from the Controlling Shareholders.
COMMUNICATION WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Company believes in high standards of transparent corporate
disclosure and is committed to disclose, to its shareholders,
