There was an increase in the Group’s overall average selling price of coal of 16% from A$114 per tonne in 2017 to A$132 per tonne in 2018,
mainly as a result of the increase in global coal market prices during this period, including low-ash thermal coal prices increasing by approximately
US$19 per tonne and semi-soft metallurgical coal prices increasing by approximately US$15 per tonne. The Group’s average selling price of
thermal coal increased from A$102 per tonne to A$123 per tonne, while its average selling price of metallurgical coal increased from A$165
per tonne to A$182 per tonne. Ex-mine thermal sales represented 85% of total ex-mine sales volume in 2018; an increase from 80% in 2017.
There was an increase in our ex-mine sales volume of coal of 74% from 19.3Mt in 2017 to 33.5Mt in 2018, mainly due to (a) the full year effect
of the C&A Acquisition from 1 September 2017; (b) the Other acquisitions and disposals completed during 2018; and (c) the expansion of
Moolarben from 10.2Mt in 2017 to 13.5Mt (equity) in 2018.

(1)	 2017 includes the reclassification of $85 million of revenue on the BLCP contract from Australia to Thailand.
(2)	 Others includes Malaysia, Germany, Vietnam, India and Switzerland.
The Group achieved an increase in revenue from external customers across each of its key geographic markets. In particular, substantial
increases in revenue from 2017 to 2018 from (i) $489 million to $1,055 million in Japan, (ii) $337 million to $861 million in Singapore,
(iii) $415 million to $664 million in South Korea and (iv) $131 million to $518 million in Taiwan. The increases in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan
were primarily attributable to the C&A Acquisition, with the quality of coal from the HVO and MTW mines being suitable for these typically higher
priced markets.
The increase in the PRC was primarily due to efforts to increase sales of the Group’s higher-ash products to end users in the PRC.
The increase in Thailand was attributable to the full year effect of a long-term supply contract acquired as part of the C&A Acquisition.
