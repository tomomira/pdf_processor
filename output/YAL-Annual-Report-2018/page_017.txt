CASH FLOW ELEMENTS
Net operating cash inflows increased 328% to
$1,747 million mainly reflecting the higher EBITDA.
Net investing cash outflows were $55 million; asset
disposals and loan repayments offset capital
expenditure and JV stake acquisitions.
Net financing cash outflows were $904 million;
mostly due to the $1,014 million of voluntary net
debt repayments and the $130 million interim
dividend. The $268 million raised in the Hong Kong
IPO was a positive inflow.
The overall outcome was a $824 million increase in
the net cash position to $1,031 million. This
increase facilitated the final and special dividend
payment decision.
FINANCIAL RESOURCES
The Group defines its gearing ratio as net debt
(being interest-bearing liabilities less cash and
cash equivalents) divided by net debt + total equity.
As a result of the net debt being cut by $1.4 billion
during 2018, the gearing ratio has improved
significantly. It decreased from 47% at 31
December 2017 to 35% at 31 December 2018.
DIVIDENDS AND DEBT REDUCTION
On 25 February 2019, Yancoal announced a final
dividend of A$377 million, with a record date of
11 March 2019. The final dividend and special
dividend will be paid on 30 April 2019.
On 25 February 2019, Yancoal announced it would
pre-pay a further US$500 million in loans, reducing
its total debt liabilities by US$1.4 billion since
September 2017.
