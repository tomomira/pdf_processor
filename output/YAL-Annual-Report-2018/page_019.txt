RISING PREMIUM FOR HIGHER ENERGY AUSTRALIAN COAL
PRICE-RELATED
Australia has a critical role supplying premium-
grade thermal and metallurgical coals to the global
market, and yet supply growth faces ongoing
challenges associated with obtaining development
approvals for new operations.
Seaborne supply from South Africa, Russia and
Indonesia is also likely to be constrained to satisfy
their domestic energy requirements; and is likely
to positively impact international coal prices.
It is the locally-based operators with brownfield
expansion opportunities, such as Yancoal, that
are best placed to benefit from the combination
of sustained global demand for high quality coal
and a limited greenfield supply response.
Given the demand outlook, this has the potential
to continue supporting premium coal prices.
Based on pure market supply and demand
fundamentals, Yancoal starts the year anticipating
coal price stability in 2019.
DIVERSE CUSTOMER BASE
OUTLOOK
MARKET DEMAND
Demand for high quality, low-ash and low-sulphur
coals remains strong, as developed economies in
Asia including Japan, Korea and Taiwan continue
to implement environmental policies requiring coal
users to consume cleaner, higher grades of
product. As higher grades of coal quality remain
in tight supply, the premiums captured by suppliers
should remain supported during 2019.
Asia remains a dynamic market, with coal currently
representing over 50% of the Asian energy
requirement and it remains the cheapest energy
source for developing nations. China continues
to introduce an alternative energy policy, but it also
needs the certainty of a baseload energy supply.
The middle ground sees Chinese buyers seeking
higher CV and low-sulphur coals, as focus shifts
towards a more significant proportion of import
coals with an energy level higher than 5,000 kCal/
kg NAR. This scenario is constructive for the price
outlook on Yancoal thermal coal products.
Statistics indicate Australia will continue to retain
a market share of approximately 26% of the
growing world seaborne thermal coal requirement1.
As Australia’s largest pure-play coal producer
Yancoal is well positioned to participate in the
seaborne market.
Yancoal has a diverse customer base by
geography. In 2018 no one country contributed
more than 22% of the revenue generated by the
Company. This customer split provides insulation
from regional demand disruption should it occur.
