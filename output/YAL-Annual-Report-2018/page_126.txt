The goodwill at 31 December 2018 relates to the acquisition of Yancoal Resources Limited (formally known as Felix Resources Limited) from an
independent third party in an arm’s length transaction and was allocated to the Yarrabee mine. Refer to Note C3 for the details regarding the fair
value less cost to sell calculation performed at 31 December 2018. The CGU for which goodwill was allocated was not subject to an impairment
charge as the recoverable amount is greater than the carrying value for this CGU.
