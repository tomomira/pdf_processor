Net operating cash flows
Net operating cash inflows increased by $1,339 million (328%) to $1,747 million mainly reflecting the higher operating EBITDA, positively
impacted by the increase in coal prices and the full year effect of the C&A Acquisition and the Moolarben expansion.
Net investing cash flows
Net investing cash outflows decreased by $3,331 million (98%) to $55 million mainly reflecting the acquisitions and disposals undertaken by the
Group. In 2018 investing cash outflows included (i) $353 million paid for a further 28.9% interest in the Warkworth joint venture and a further 4%
in the Moolarben joint venture net of cash acquired; (ii) $194 million of capital expenditure; and (iii) $123 million provided to Watagan under the
Watagan loan facility. These outflows were partially offset by inflows including (i) $524 million received on the disposal of a 16.6% interest in the
HVO joint venture net of cash disposed; and (ii) $117 million received as a loan repayment from the Middlemount joint venture. In 2017 investing
cash outflows included (i) $3,247 million paid on the C&A Acquisition net of cash acquired; and (ii) $299 million of capital expenditure.
Net financing cash flows

of $1,014 million.
For the year ended 31 December 2019 the primary source of liquidity is expected to continue to be operating cash flows. Historically, the
