MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS      ANNUAL REPORT 2018      41
ROM coal production was up 62% from 41.1Mt in 2017 to 66.5Mt in 2018. This included an increase in the three tier-one assets of Moolarben,
Mount Thorley Warkworth (MTW) and Hunter Valley Operations (HVO) of 107% from 26.7Mt in 2017 to 55.2Mt in 2018.
Saleable coal production was up 59% from 31.5Mt in 2017 to 50.0Mt in 2018. This included an increase in the three tier-one assets of
Moolarben, MTW and HVO of 99% from 21.1Mt in 2017 to 41.9Mt in 2018.
Moolarben’s ROM production increased by 3.9Mt (27%) and its saleable production increased by 4.1Mt (33%) with all the increase in ROM
attributable to a full year’s production from the underground mine of 5.6Mt (2017: 1.7Mt). The further increase in saleable production was
attributable to an improved yield due to the underground coal being 100% bypass.
The increases at MTW and HVO were primarily attributable to a full year of production in 2018 compared to only the last four months of 2017.
The table below sets out the Group’s ongoing economic interest in the saleable production for each Yancoal owned mine that contributes to the
financial results of the Group; i.e. excludes Watagan.
