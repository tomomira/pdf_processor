This section of the financial statements focuses on disclosure that enhances a user’s understanding of profit after tax. Segment reporting

Comprehensive Income along with their components provide details behind the reported balances.
B1 SEGMENT INFORMATION
Accounting Policy
Management has determined the operating segments based on the strategic direction and organisational structure of the Group together
with reports reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Makers (“CODM”), defined as the Executive Committee, that are used to make
strategic decisions including resource allocation and assessment of segment performance.
The reportable segments are considered at a regional level being New South Wales (“NSW”) and Queensland (“QLD”).
Non-operating items of the Group are presented under the segment “Corporate” which includes administrative expenses, foreign exchange
gains and losses recycled from hedge reserve, and the elimination of intersegment transactions and other consolidation adjustments.
