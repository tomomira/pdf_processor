AASB 2017-6 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation
This Standard amends AASB 9 Financial Instruments to permit entities to measure at amortised cost or fair
value through other comprehensive income particular financial assets that would otherwise have contractual
cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest but do not meet that condition only as a result of
a prepayment feature. This is subject to meeting other conditions, such as the nature of the business model
relevant to the financial asset. Otherwise, the financial assets would be measured at fair value through profit
or loss. The Standard also clarifies in the Basis for Conclusion that, under AASB 9, gains and losses arising
on modifications of financial liabilities that do not result in derecognition should be recognised in profit or loss.
Impact:
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of AASB 2017-6 will have no impact on the recognition of amounts
in the Group’s financial statements, but there will be additional disclosures required.

AASB 2017-7 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures
This Standard amends AASB 128 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures to clarify that an entity is
required to account for long-term interests in an associate or joint venture, which in substance form part of the
net investment in the associate or joint venture but to which the equity method is not applied, using AASB 9
Financial Instruments before applying the loss allocation and impairment requirements in AASB 128.
Impact:
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of AASB 2017-7 will have no impact on the recognition of amounts in
the Group’s financial statements, but there will be additional disclosures required.

Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments
The Interpretation clarifies the application of the recognition and measurement criteria in AASB 112 Income
Taxes when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments. The Interpretation specifically addresses
the following:
a) 	 whether an entity considers uncertain tax treatments separately;
b) 	 the assumptions an entity makes about the examination of tax treatments by taxation authorities;
c) 	 how an entity determines taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and
tax rates; and
d) 	 how an entity considers changes in facts and circumstances.
The Group is currently adhering to this standard and there is no material impact expected on the Group’s
financial report.
