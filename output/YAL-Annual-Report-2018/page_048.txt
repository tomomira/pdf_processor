MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)
46      YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD
PRODUCTION COSTS (CONTINUED)
Government royalties
Government royalties expenses increased by 101% from $173 million
in 2017 to $347 million in 2018, primarily due to increased royalties
levied on our increased sales revenue, which were driven by both
higher prices and sales volumes. Royalties are determined on an
ad valorem basis by reference to the value of coal sold, the type of
mine and the State the mine is located in and are payable to the
appropriate State Government. This contributed to an increase in
per ex-mine sales tonne government royalties from $9 to $10 over
the same period.
Coal purchases
Coal purchases decreased by 2% from $340 million in 2017 to
$332 million in 2018. Coal purchases as a percentage of operating
revenue decreased from 13% to 7% over the same period, primarily
due to a relatively lower amount of coal blending being undertaken
on the C&A sales while we continue to evaluate and adjust to C&A’s
customer relationships and their coal quality needs.
Other operating expenses
Other operating expenses increased by 37% from $54 million in 2017
to $74 million in 2018, primarily as a result of the C&A Acquisition
and Moolarben expansion.
Share of profit of equity-accounted investees, net of tax
Share of profit of equity-accounted investees, net of tax increased
by 75% from $32 million in 2017 to $56 million in 2018 primarily
due to the improved profit after tax performance of the incorporated
Middlemount joint venture. The Group’s equity-accounted investment
in Watagan is held on the balance sheet at nil value such that the loss
after tax of the Watagan Group of $217 million for the year ended
31 December 2018 is not reflected in the Group’s Statement of profit
and loss for the same period.
Operating EBITDA and operating EBITDA margin
Operating EBITDA increased by 121% from $988 million in 2017
to $2,180 million in 2018 primarily due to an 80% increase in
operating revenue partially offset by an increase in cash operating
costs (including royalties) from $71 to $73 per tonne over the same
period. Operating EBITDA margin as a percentage of operating
revenue increased from 36% in 2017 to 45% in 2018.
Depreciation and amortisation
Depreciation and amortisation expenses increased by 104%
from $256 million in 2017 to $523 million in 2018, primarily due
to an increase in mining tenements and plant and equipment of
$2,456 million and $1,326 million, respectively, from the C&A
Acquisition, together with expansionary capital incurred at Moolarben.
Per ex-mine sales tonne depreciation and amortisation costs
increased from $14 to $16 over the same period.
Operating EBIT and operating EBIT margin
Operating EBIT increased by 126% from $732 million in 2017 to
$1,657 million in 2018 primarily due to an 80% increase in operating
revenue partially offset by an increase in cash operating costs
(including royalties) from $71 to $73 per tonne and an increase in
depreciation and amortisation from $14 to $16 per tonne over the
same period. Operating EBIT margin as a percentage of operating
revenue increased from 27% in 2017 to 34% in 2018.
Net finance costs
Net finance costs decreased by 4% from $282 million in 2017
to $270 million in 2018, primarily due to (i) an overall reduction in
interest-bearing liabilities during 2018 compared to 2017 following
several voluntary loan repayments and (ii) a reduction in the Yanzhou
guarantee fee provided on the Group’s syndicated facility being
partially offset by (i) an increase in LIBOR during the year from
an average of 1.17% in 2017 to an average of 2.43% in 2018
and (ii) a decrease in the A$:US$ exchange rate resulting in an
increase in the Australian dollar finance charge. Net finance costs
as a percentage of operating revenue decreased from 9% to 6%
over the same period, primarily due to the C&A Acquisition being
equity‑funded, which reduced the Group’s overall gearing levels.
Profit before income tax and profit before income tax margin
As a result of the aforementioned reasons, profit before income tax
increased by 277% from $311 million in 2017 to $1,172 million in
2018. Profit before income tax margin as a percentage of operating
revenue increased from 11% to 24% over the same period.
Income tax expense
Income tax expense increased by 290% from $82 million in 2017
to $320 million in 2018. The effective tax rate was 26.4% and 27.3%
in the same years, respectively, which is lower than the Australian
corporate income tax rate of 30%. In 2018 the lower effective tax rate
primarily resulted from certain non-assessable income items including
the Group’s share of equity-accounted profits and part of the gain
on the partial disposal of HVO and an over provision in the prior
year. In 2017 the lower effective tax rate also primarily resulted from
certain non-assessable income items including the Group’s share of
equity‑accounted profits and the gain on the C&A Acquisition partially
offset by non-deductible stamp duty incurred on the C&A Acquisition.
Profit after income tax and profit after income tax margin
As a result of the aforementioned reasons, profit after income tax
increased by 272% from $229 million in 2017 to $852 million in 2018.
Profit after income tax margin as a percentage of operating revenue
increased from 8% to 17% over the same period.
