(i)	 subject to (ii) below, pay as interim and/or final dividends not
less than 40% of net profit after tax (pre-abnormal items) in

PRE-EMPTIVE RIGHTS ON NEW ISSUES OF SHARES
Under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), shareholders do not have
the right to be offered any Shares which are newly issued for cash
before those Shares can be offered to non-shareholders.
PUBLIC FLOAT
Rule 8.08(1)(a) of the Hong Kong Listing Rules requires that at least
25% of an issuer’s total issued share capital must at all times be held
by the public. The Company obtained a waiver under Rule 8.08(1)(d)
of the Hong Kong Listing Rules to accept a lower public float
percentage and the Company’s minimum public float is approximately
15.37%. Due to an inadvertent oversight, the minimum public float
percentage was incorrectly stated as approximately 15.39% (instead
of 15.37%) in the Company’s announcement of the partial exercise of
the over-allotment option dated 31 December 2018.
Based on the information that is publicly available to the Company
and within the knowledge of the Directors as at the date of this
report, the Company has maintained the minimum public float of
approximately 15.37% under the HK Listing Rules.
FULFILMENT OF CONDITIONS AND UNDERTAKINGS
The Company confirms that it has complied with the conditions and
undertakings imposed by The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited
during the period from 6 December 2018 (the date on which dealings
in the Shares were permitted to take place on the Main Board of the
HKEx in Hong Kong) to 31 December 2018.
USE OF IPO PROCEEDS
In connection with the global offering in Hong Kong, which was
completed on 3 January 2019 (the “Global Offering”), the Company
allotted and issued 59,441,900 new shares on 6 December 2018,
563,881 new shares on 28 December 2018 and 4,361,900 new
shares on 3 January 2019 at a price of HK$23.48 per share and
raised HK$1,511 million (A$268 million) in total gross proceeds. The
net proceeds from the Global Offering amounted to approximately
