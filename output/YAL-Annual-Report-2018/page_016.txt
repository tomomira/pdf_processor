INCOME STATEMENT
ELEMENTS
REVENUE AND COSTS
Total Revenue increased by 80% from $2,716
million in 2017 to $4,891 million in 2018. A 74%
uplift in the sales volume and a 16% increase
in the average sale price drove the strong
revenue performance.
The Operating Cash Costs increased by less than
2% to $63/t. Including royalties and the non-cash
depreciation and amortisation charges, the Total
Production Costs increased by less than 5% to
$89/t. These costs compare to an average sale
price of $132/t across all the coal sold.
OPERATING EBITDA AND OPERATING
EBITDA MARGIN
Operating EBITDA increased by 121% from
$988 million in 2017 to $2,180 million in 2018.
The EBITDA flows directly from the higher
revenue with a modest offset from the cash
costs (A$73/t including royalties). Consequently,
Operating EBITDA margin as a percentage of
Operating Revenue increased from 36% in 2017
to 45% in 2018.
DEPRECIATION AND AMORTISATION
Depreciation and amortisation expenses increased
by 104% from $256 million in 2017 to $523 million
in 2018. The increase primarily stemmed from the
increased asset base following the Coal & Allied
acquisition. On a per tonne basis, the depreciation
and amortisation costs increased from $14/t to
$16/t in 2018.
NET FINANCE COSTS
Net finance costs decreased by 4% from $282
million in 2017 to $270 million in 2018, primarily
due to the ongoing voluntary loan repayments.
INCOME TAX EXPENSE
It is important to note that the Company did
not pay any cash tax in 2018; this is due to tax
losses carried forward from prior years. There
are further tax losses to be utilised in future years.
For accounting purposes, the Income tax expense
was $320 million in 2018, and the effective tax rate
was 27.3%.
NET PROFIT AFTER TAX
These elements combined to deliver a profit after
income tax that increased 272% from $229 million
in 2017 to $852 million in 2018.
Total Revenue increased by 86% from
$2,601 million in 2017 to $4,891 million
in 2018. A 68% uplift in the sales volume
and a 16% increase in the average sale
price drove the strong revenue performance.
