(i) Investment in associates
Watagan Mining Company Pty Ltd
During 2015 the Group established a 100% owned subsidiary, Watagan Mining Company Pty Ltd (“Watagan”). On 18 February 2016, the
Group executed a Bond Subscription Agreement, together with other agreements (the “Watagan Agreements”) that, on completion, transferred
the Group’s interest in three of its 100% owned NSW coal mining operations, being the Austar, Ashton and Donaldson coal mines (the “three
mines”), to Watagan for a purchase price of $1,363.4 million (an amount equal to the book value of the three mines at completion). The purchase
price was funded by way of a $1,363.4 million loan from Yancoal Australia Ltd to Watagan bearing interest at BBSY plus 7.06% with a maturity
date of 1 April 2025. The outstanding interest and principal of this loan is guaranteed by Yankuang Group Co., Ltd (“Yankuang”), the Group’s
ultimate parent entity. The completion date of the transaction was 31 March 2016.
On completion Watagan issued US$775 million of secured debt bonds with a term of approximately nine years to three external financiers
(“Bondholders”). The Bondholders receive interest on the face value outstanding on the bonds comprising a fixed interest component, as well as
a variable interest component that is tied to the EBITDA performance of Watagan. As a result of the terms of the Watagan Agreements, it was
determined that the Bondholders obtained accounting control of Watagan; accordingly, the Group de-consolidated Watagan.
This change in accounting control was determined to occur on the issuance date of the bonds on the basis that the Bondholders obtained
power over the key operating and strategic decisions of Watagan and no longer resided with the Group. Specifically, those powers were
transferred to the Bondholders under the terms of the Watagan Agreements as the Bondholders were given control of Watagan’s Board of
Directors via appointment of the majority of Directors. This change in accounting control resulted in the Group de-consolidating the results of
Watagan from the transaction completion date and the Group began to equity account for its 100% equity interest in Watagan as an associate,
given the Group retains significant influence in Watagan.
On 4 January 2019 BOCI (one of the Bondholders) notified Watagan and Yankuang that it was exercising its put option over US$200 million
of bonds. As a consequence, Yankuang will become the bondholder of the put bonds following completion of the purchase of those bonds
by Yankuang expected to occur on or around 1 April 2019. No security will be given by Watagan in favour of Yankuang. As the put bonds
represent less than 50.1% of the face value of the bonds, and the put option was not exercised by the instructing bondholder, the put option
is not deemed to have been exercised as to all the bonds, nor has the Group regained accounting control of Watagan. Accordingly, the Group
continues to equity account its interest in Watagan.
Whilst Watagan is equity accounted rather than consolidated for accounting purposes, as a result of the Group’s ongoing 100% equity
ownership it remains within the Group’s tax consolidated group.
