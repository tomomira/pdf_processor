Transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligation
As discussed in Note B2, for long-term contracts the Group has concluded that contracts with customers do not exist for those shipments for
which the actual delivery quantity and transaction price have not yet been negotiated or determined. For the remaining shipments where the
delivery quantity and transaction price have been negotiated or determined but are subject to market price movements, the contract durations
are within one year or less. As a result, the Group elects to apply the practical expedient in paragraph 121(a) of AASB 15 and does not disclose
information about the remaining performance obligations in relation to the coal sales contracts. The Group also elects to apply the practical
expedient in paragraph 121(b) of AASB 15 and does not disclose information about the remaining performance obligations in relation to the
management and mining service contracts.
