The Yancoal team has implemented our
operational and corporate strategies to deliver the
robust financial rebound we promised shareholders
during our acquisition of Coal & Allied.
Supported by our leadership team, the Board and
our majority shareholders, we have set a new
standard of success for our business and
defined Yancoal as consistently exceeding
market expectations.
SAFETY
In a year of continued growth and financial
achievement, I am encouraged by the significant
improvement in our safety performance.
Yancoal’s operations reported a Total Recordable
Injury Frequency Rate (“TRIFR”) of 7.74 for 2018,
down from 10.43 in the year prior. Such a result
highlights the success of the roll-out of our Critical
Controls safety training and education program,
as well as the importance of instituting safety
as a core value of the Yancoal Way.
TRIFR for the combined Watagan assets of
Austar and Ashton, managed by Yancoal, was
also significantly improved on the year prior – with
a 2018 total of 23.04, down from 33.54 in 2017.
By understanding our individual responsibility
for the safety of ourselves and those working
alongside us, we can continue to work towards
our ambitious goal of achieving zero harm at
our operations.
There are no shortcuts when it comes to safety
and we continue to look for new ways of working
to always protect our people.

This year’s exceptional financial
and production results are attributable
to our people and their commitment
to drive our business forward.
