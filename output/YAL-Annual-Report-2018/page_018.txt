STRENGTH IN 2018
During 2018 the Average Selling Price Yancoal
achieved for its thermal coal output was
A$123/tonne, this was a 21% increase from
A$102/tonne in 2017. Similarly, the Average
Selling Price achieved for metallurgical coal
output was A$182/tonne, a 10% increase from
A$165/tonne in 2017.
An increasing premium for high-energy thermal
coal aided the price achieved by Yancoal.
Between the two index prices for exports from
Newcastle, the price premium for the higher
energy content coal (6,000 kCal vs 5,500 kCal)
increased from an average of 25% in 2017 to
52% in 2018.
Thermal coal sales dominate Yancoal’s product
mix; in 2018 this was 85% of the ex-mine sales
volume. The ratio increased from 80% in 2017
as a result of the new asset mix following the Coal
& Allied transaction in late 2017. The combined
outcome of the product mix and sales prices
was a 16% increase in average prices across
all attributable coal sales to A$132/t in 2018.
Yancoal remains focused on its sizable
and diverse customer base. The Company
emphasis is maximising the product mix
to optimise revenues across various global
markets. The high quality coal products are
suited to the needs of end-users in the prime
target markets of Japan, Korea and China.
