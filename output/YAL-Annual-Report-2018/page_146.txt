D9 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)
(c) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk includes the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group will be impacted in the
following ways:
(i)	 will not have sufficient funds to settle transactions on the due date;
(ii)	 will be forced to sell financial assets at a value which is less than what they are worth; or
(iii)	 may be unable to settle or recover a financial asset at all.
Liquidity risk is managed by maintaining sufficient cash and liquid deposit balances and having readily accessible standby facilities in place
in accordance with the Board’s risk management policy. Details regarding finance facilities are set out in Note D2.
Maturities of financial liabilities
The tables below analyse the Group’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on their contractual maturities and interest
payments for all liabilities.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows including interest payments. Balances due within 12 months
equal their carrying balances as the impact of discounting is not significant.

(d) Fair value measurements
(i) Fair value hierarchy
The Group uses various methods in estimating the fair value of financial instruments. AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement requires disclosure
of fair value measurements by level in accordance with the following fair value measurement hierarchy:
(a)	 quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1);
(b)	 inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly
(derived from prices) (Level 2); and
(c)	 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) (Level 3).
The following table presents the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities measured and recognised at fair value at 31 December 2018
and 31 December 2017:
