for the Group
Not yet issued
by the AASB
(continued)
Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards has also been issued, which sets
out the amendments to affected standards in order to update references to the revised Conceptual Framework.
The changes to the Conceptual Framework may affect the application of IFRS in situations where no standard
applies to a particular transaction or event. In addition, relief has been provided in applying IFRS 3 and
developing accounting policies for regulatory account balances using IAS 8, such that entities must continue to
apply the definitions of an asset and a liability (and supporting concepts) in the 2010 Conceptual Framework,
and not the definitions in the revised Conceptual Framework.
Impact:
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these updates will have no impact on the recognition of amounts
in the Group’s financial statements, but there will be additional disclosures required.
AASB 2014-10 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and
its Associate or Joint Venture
The amendments clarify that a full gain or loss is recognised when a transfer to an associate or joint venture
involves a business as defined in AASB 3 Business Combinations. Any gain or loss resulting from the sale or
contribution of assets that does not constitute a business, however, is recognised only to the extent of unrelated
investors’ interests in the associate or joint venture. AASB 2015-10 deferred the mandatory effective date
(application date) of AASB 2014-10 so that the amendments were required to be applied for annual reporting
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 instead of 1 January 2016. AASB 2017-5 further defers the
effective date of the amendments made in AAS SB 2014-10 to periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022.
Impact:
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of this amendment will have no impact on the recognition of amounts
in the Group’s financial statements, but there will be additional disclosures required.
