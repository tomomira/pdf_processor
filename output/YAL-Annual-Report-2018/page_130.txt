NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018
128      YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD
C11 PROVISIONS
Accounting Policies
Provisions are:
––
recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event; it is probable that cash will be required to
settle the obligation; and the amount has been reliably estimated; and
––
measured at the present value of management’s best estimate at reporting date of the cash outflow required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability where the time value is material. Any increase in the provision due to the
passage of the time is recognised as an interest expense.

Provision
Description
Employee benefits
The provision for employee benefits represents long service leave and annual leave entitlements and other incentives
accrued by employees.
Rehabilitation costs
Mining lease agreements and exploration permits impose obligations on the Group to rehabilitate areas where mining
activity has taken place. Rehabilitation of these areas is ongoing and in some cases will continue until 2060. The provision
for rehabilitation costs has been calculated based on the present value of the future costs expected to be incurred in
restoring affected mining areas, assuming current technologies.
Key estimate and judgement:
The rehabilitation provision has been created based on management’s internal estimates and assumptions relating
to the current economic environment, which management believes is a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the
future liability.
These estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions; however actual
rehabilitation costs will ultimately depend upon the future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works and
the timing of when the rehabilitation costs are incurred. Timing is dependent upon when the mines cease to produce
at economically viable rates, which in turn will depend upon future coal prices, which are inherently uncertain.
Take or pay
In acquiring part of a business or operation, an assessment is made on the fair value of the assets and liabilities under
AASB 3 Business Combinations. Take or pay is the assessment of forecast excess capacity for port and rail contracts.
A provision was recognised for the discounted estimated excess capacity. The provision has a finite life and will be
released to profit or loss over the period in which excess capacity is realised.
Key estimate and judgement:
The provision is recognised and estimated based on management’s assessment of contracted port capacity versus
forecast usage. This involves making assumptions about the probability, amount and timing of an outflow of resources
embodying economic benefits.
