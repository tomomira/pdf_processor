NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      ANNUAL REPORT 2018      139
(c) Treasury share reserve
On 28 February 2018, the establishment of an employee incentive share scheme was approved by the Company’s Board of Directors.
Pursuant to the scheme, the Group has set up a trust for the purpose of administering the incentive share scheme and holding the shares
before they vest. The Company shall pay the trustee monies and give directions to the trustee to apply such monies and/or such other net
amount of cash derived from shares held as part of the fund of the trusts to acquire shares from the market, and/or to allot and issue shares
to the trustee, to satisfy any award made to selected participants. The Company shall select eligible persons from time to time and determine
the number of shares to be awarded to such eligible persons.
During the year 42,574,974 shares were purchased off market by the trust for $6 million and as noted below in Note D6(c) 41,482,103 shares
were provided to certain employees on 1 September 2018 for $6 million, leaving 1,092,871 shares in the trust after the award. On 28 September
2018 the share consolidation of 35 ordinary shares for one ordinary share left the balance remaining in the trust as at 31 December 2018 of
31,225 ordinary shares.
(d) Employee compensation reserve
The fair value of equity plans granted is recognised in the employee compensation reserve over the vesting period. This reserve will be reversed
against treasury shares when the underlying shares vest and transfer to the employee at the fair value. The difference between the fair value at
grant date and the amount received against treasury shares is recognised in retained earnings (net of tax).
During the year ended 31 December 2018, a total of 41,482,104 shares of the Company based on A$0.141 (pre share consolidation) per share
or $6 million, have been awarded to certain employees of the Group respectively at no consideration, which vested on 1 September 2018.
With respect to this award of shares to eligible employees, there are no service or performance vesting conditions.
In addition $7 million (net of tax) has been recognised in relation to the current year LTIP and deferred STIP as discussed in the remuneration report.

The Company has issued a letter of support dated 4 March 2015 to Middlemount Coal Pty Ltd (“Middlemount”), a joint venture of the
Group confirming:
––
it will not demand the repayment of any loan due from Middlemount, except to the extent that Middlemount agrees otherwise or as otherwise
provided in the loan agreement; and
––
it will provide financial support to Middlemount to enable it to meet its debts as and when they become due and payable, by way of new
shareholder loans in proportion to its share of the net assets of Middlemount.
This letter of support will remain in force whilst the Group is a shareholder of Middlemount or until notice of not less than 12 months is provided
or such shorter period as agreed by Middlemount.
(iii) Other contingencies
A number of claims have been made against the Group, including in respect of personal injuries, and in relation to contracts which Group
members are party to as part of the Group’s day to day operations. The personal injury claims which have been made against the Group have
largely been assumed by the insurers of the Group under the Group’s insurance policies. The Directors do not believe that the outcome of these
claims will have a material impact on the Group’s financial position.
