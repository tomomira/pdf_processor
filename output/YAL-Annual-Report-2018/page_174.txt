INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD
Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the fi nancial statements of Yancoal Australia Ltd (the Company) and its controlled entities
(the Group), which comprises the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2018, the consolidated
statement of profi t or loss and other comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity
and the consolidated statement of cash fl ows for the year then ended, notes comprising a summary of
signifi cant accounting policies and other explanatory information, and the directors’ declaration.
In our opinion:
1. the accompanying fi nancial statements of the Group are in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001,
including:
1.1 giving a true and fair view of the Group’s fi nancial position as at 31 December 2018 and of its
performance for the year then ended; and
1.2 complying with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Regulations 2001.
2. the fi nancial statements also comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
as disclosed in Note A(i).
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we
comply with relevant ethical requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the fi nancial statements are free from material misstatement.
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the Audit of the
Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Corporations
Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board’s APES 110
Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (the Code) that are relevant to our audit of the fi nancial statements in
Australia. We have also fulfi lled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suffi  cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most signifi cance in our audit of
the fi nancial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018. These matters were addressed in the context of
our audit of the fi nancial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a
separate opinion on these matters.
