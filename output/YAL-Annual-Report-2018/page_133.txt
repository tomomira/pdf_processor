Interest costs incurred on finance leases amounted to $3 million to 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: $3 million).
On the adoption of AASB 9 Financial Instruments the secured bank loans were adjusted as a result of a refinancing during 2017. Refer to Note
F7 for details on the adjustment. The initial recognition of AU$31 million less AU$7 million amortised in 2017 was taken to retained earnings.
During 2018 AU$10 million was amortised to amortisation of non-substantial loan refinance in finance costs. This amount will continue to
amortise up to the date of maturity/repayment, at which time the full face value of the secured bank loans will be recognised.

(i) Syndicated Facility
In 2009 a Syndicated loan facility of US$2,600 million was taken out and fully drawn down to fund the acquisition of the Felix Resources Group.
During 2014, the Syndicated Facility was extended with repayments due in 2020, 2021 and 2022. During 2018 US$925 million (31 December
2017: US$150 million) was repaid reducing the facility to US$1,525 million (31 December 2017: US$2,450 million).
Security is held over these loans in the form of a corporate guarantee issued by the Company’s majority shareholder, Yanzhou Coal Mining
Company Limited (“Yanzhou”), for the full amount of the facility.
As part of the acquisition of Coal & Allied Industries Ltd on 1 September 2017 the financial covenants were adjusted from that date.
The Syndicated Facility includes the following financial covenants to be tested half-yearly:
(a)	 The interest cover ratio is greater than 1.40;
(b)	 The gearing ratio of the Group will not exceed 0.75; and
(c)	 The consolidated net worth of the Group is greater than AU$3,000 million.
The calculation of the above covenants includes certain exclusions with regard to unrealised gains and losses including foreign exchange gains
and losses.
