NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      ANNUAL REPORT 2018      143
Sensitivity
The following table summarises the sensitivity of the Group’s significant financial assets and liabilities to changes in variable interest rates.
This sensitivity is based on reasonably possible changes, determined using observed historical interest rate movements for the preceding five-
year period, with a heavier weighting given to more recent market data. Past movements are not necessarily indicative of future movements.
For financial assets, a 25 basis point (decrease)/increase in interest rates would have (decreased)/increased equity and profit or loss after tax by
the amounts shown below. For financial liabilities, a 25 basis point (decrease)/increase in interest rates would have increased/(decreased) equity
and profit or loss after tax by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.

(b) Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. As at
31 December 2018 the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk which will cause a financial loss to the Group due to failure to discharge
an obligation by the counterparties and financial guarantees provided by the Group is arising from the carrying amount of the respective
recognised financial assets as stated in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the amount of contingent liabilities in relation to financial
guarantees issued by the Group as disclosed in Note D8.
In order to minimise credit risk, the management of the Group has delegated a team responsible for determination of credit limits, credit
approvals and other monitoring procedures to ensure that follow-up action is taken to recover overdue debts. In addition, the Group reviews
the recoverable amount of each individual trade debt at the end of the reporting period to ensure that adequate impairment losses are made
for irrecoverable amounts. In this regard, the Directors consider that the Group’s credit risk is significantly reduced. The Group maintains its
cash and cash equivalents with reputable banks. Therefore, the Directors consider that the credit risk for such amounts is minimal.
In assessing the Expected Credit Losses (“ECL”) of trade receivables management assesses historical write-offs of trade receivables, ageing
of debtors and whether sufficient credit enhancement is provided by customers (letters of credit and bank guarantees). If the ageing of trade
receivables significantly increased then the recognition of ECL would need to be reassessed.
Receivables will only be written off if there is demonstrable evidence that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.
There was no provision for lifetime or 12-month ECL recognised for trade receivables as at 31 December 2018 as there are minimal aged debts.
The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited as the counterparties are banks with credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating
agencies that are at least investment grade.
Credit risk in trade receivables is managed in the following ways:
(i)	 payment terms and credit limits are set for individual customers;
(ii)	 a risk assessment process is used for all customers; and
(iii)	 letters of credit are required for those customers assessed as posing a higher risk.
As disclosed in Note D2(a)(i) the minimum average balance of AU$25 million per day and at month end AU$50 million is required to be held
in the Lender Accounts of the Syndicated Facility which is not available for use on those days.
The maximum exposure to credit risk on financial assets which have been recognised in the balance sheet is their carrying amount less
impairment provision, if any, as set out below.
