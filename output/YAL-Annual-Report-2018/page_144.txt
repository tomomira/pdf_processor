Equity movements above reflect movements in the hedge reserve due to foreign exchange movements on USD interest-bearing loans.
(ii) Price risk
The price risk of the Group includes coal price risk.
The Group does not enter into commodity contracts other than to meet the Group’s expected usage and sales requirements; such contracts are
not settled net. The royalty receivables from Middlemount are exposed to fluctuations in coal price. The Group currently does not have any derivative
hedges in place against the movement in the spot coal price. Refer to Note D9(d)(iii) for the royalty receivable coal price sensitivity analysis.
Coal sales are predominately provisionally priced initially. Provisionally priced sales are those for which price finalisation, referenced to the relevant
index, is outstanding at the reporting date. Provisional pricing mechanisms embedded within these sales arrangements have the character of a
commodity derivative and are carried at fair value through profit and loss as part of trade receivables. The final sales price is determined normally
seven to 90 days after delivery to the customer. At 31 December 2018 there were $234 million of provisionally priced sales. If prices were to
increase by 10% provisionally priced sales would increase by $23 million.
(iii) Interest rate risk
The Group is subject to interest rate risk that arises from borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash. Generally, no variable
interest is receivable or payable on the Group’s trade and other receivables or payables where applicable as they are fixed in nature and therefore
they are not exposed to the interest rate risk.
The Group’s cash flow interest rate risk for assets primarily arises from cash at bank and deposits subject to market bank rates. Floating rate
borrowings bearing LIBOR rates are re-set on a quarterly basis.
The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk and the weighted average interest rate is set out as below:
