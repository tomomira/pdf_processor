SAFETY
At Yancoal the safety of employees and the many
contractors and service providers that support
operations is considered in everything we do.
The TRIFR steadily improved throughout 2018.
TRIFR was 10.43 at the end of 2017; by the end
of 2018 it was 7.74. This improvement flowed
from the integration and aligning of safety systems
following the Coal & Allied acquisition. The trend
reflects the Company’s emphasis on safety.
Implementation of the Core Hazard Critical
Control program continued with the focus shifting
towards verification of Critical Controls and their
effectiveness across operational sites.
The Health, Safety and Environment Committee
continues to lead the Group in its objective
of “zero harm”.
