CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (CONTINUED)
84      YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD
The Chairman ensures that Directors have the opportunity
to contribute to Board deliberations. The Chairman regularly
communicates with the CEC and CEO and to review key issues
and performance trends. The Chairman, together with the Co-Vice
Chairmen, Fucun Wang and Gregory Fletcher, also represent the
Company in the wider community.
The Chief Executive Officer is Reinhold Schmidt. The CEO is
responsible for conduct and supervision of the management function
of the Company, including implementing strategic objectives,
plans and budgets approved by the Board. The CEO has overall
responsibility for the Company’s operations (other than as delegated
to the Chairman of the Executive Committee (CEC)) and undertaking
such responsibilities as may be delegated to him by the Board from
time to time. The CEO is accountable to the Board and reports to the
Chairman of the Board and the CEC.
The roles of the Chairman and the CEO are separate and assumed
by different individuals to ensure a balance of power and authority,
so that power is not concentrated in any one individual of the Board.
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman and
the CEO.
