A	 Relating to the 2018 LTIP award. The number of performance rights granted
is calculated as the maximum LTIP award opportunity divided by the VWAP
across a 20-day trading period spread evenly either side of 31 December 2017.
The number of performance share rights was adjusted due to the 35:1 share
consolidation undertaken by the Company in September 2018.
B	 Relating to the special incentives and transaction bonuses in relation to 2017
performance which were to be settled in cash, but were settled in equity.
Performance rights were granted on 30 May 2018 and vested on 1 September
2018. The number of shares granted was calculated by dividing the award value
by the VWAP across a 20-day trading period spread evenly either side of 31
December 2017.
C	 Relating to the portion of 2018 STIP that is deferred into equity.
D	 Baocai Zhang was an Executive Director until 8 June 2018.
E	 Paul Stringer is considered a KMP from 29 May 2018 to 31 December 2018.
9.	 Other transactions with and loans to Directors and
Executives
A number of Directors and Executives hold positions in other entities
that result in them having control or significant influence over the
financial or operating policies of those entities.
Some of these entities transacted with the Company or its
subsidiaries in the reporting period. The terms and conditions of any
transactions with management, Directors or parties related to KMP
or Directors were no more favourable than those available, or which
might reasonably be expected to be available, on similar transactions
to non-management or Director related persons or entities on an
arm’s length basis (refer to Note E3). There were no loans provided to
Directors and Executives during the year.
DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS IN TRANSACTIONS, ARRANGEMENTS
OR CONTRACTS
No transactions, arrangements or contracts of significance in relation
to the Group’s business to which any of the Company’s subsidiaries
and fellow subsidiaries was a party, and in which a Director or an
entity connected with a Director had a material interest, whether
directly or indirectly, subsisted at any time during the year or at the
end of the year.
INSURANCE OF OFFICERS OR AUDITORS
Rule 10.2 of Yancoal’s Constitution requires Yancoal to indemnify,
to the full extent permitted by law, each Officer of the Company
against liability incurred by the Officer as a Director or an Officer of
the Company. The Directors named in this report, along with the
Company Secretary, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, have the benefit of this requirement, as do individuals who
formerly held one of those positions.
During the financial year, the Company paid a premium for Directors’
and Officers’ Liability insurance as well as Defence Costs cover.
The policies cover the Directors and other officers of the Group.
The Directors have not included details of the nature of the liabilities
covered and the amount of premium paid in respect of the Directors’
and Officers’ Liability insurance policy as such disclosure is prohibited
under the terms of insurance contracts.
Proceedings on behalf of the Company
No person has applied to the Court under section 237 of the
Corporations Act 2001 for leave to bring proceedings on behalf of the
Company, or to intervene in any proceedings to which the Company
is a party, for the purpose of taking responsibility on behalf of the
Company for all or part of those proceedings.
No proceedings have been brought or intervened in on behalf of
the Company with leave of the Court under section 237 of the
Corporations Act 2001.

additional to its statutory audit duties where the auditor’s expertise
and experience with the Group are important.
