NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      ANNUAL REPORT 2018      167
Derecognition
A financial asset is derecognised only when the contractual rights to
the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial
asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the
asset to another entity.
On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference
between the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the
consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or
loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income and
accumulated in investment revaluation reserve is recognised in profit
or loss.
A financial liability is derecognised when, and only when, the Group’s
obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire. The difference
between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and
the consideration paid and payable is recognised in profit or loss.
F7 NEW AND AMENDED STANDARDS ADOPTED BY THE GROUP
(i) New and amended standards adopted by the Group
Effective from 1 January 2018 the Group adopted the new standards
including AASB 9 Financial Instruments and AASB 15 Revenue from
Contracts with Customers. The impact of adopting these standards is
as follows:
AASB 9 Financial Instruments
The adoption of AASB 9 Financial Instruments resulted in the
following changes:
Financial Assets
All financial assets that were classified as loans and receivables were
classified as assets held at amortised cost except for the Wiggins
Island Preferences Shares (“WIPS”) which have been revalued to nil
at 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: $29 million). These have
been reclassified as assets held at fair value through profit or loss
(“FVTPL”). The valuation at 31 December 2017 did not need adjusting
as the fair value approximated the carrying amount. The WIPS are still
classified as trade and other receivables.
Financial Liabilities
Classification of financial liabilities remains the same as under the old
accounting standards. The measurement of financial liabilities has
required an adjustment to non-current interest-bearing liabilities as
there was a non-substantial modification to the Bank of China facilities
completed in August 2017. This involved modifying the terms of this
loan to change the interest structure from US Libor +2.8% increasing
to US Libor +5% over time, adjusted to US Libor +3.1% applicable
from June 2017 and adjustments to agency fees over the remaining
loan life.
Under AASB 9, a key determinant of whether a modification is
considered substantial or non-substantial is a quantitative assessment
of whether the discounted cash flows under the new terms, using
the original effective interest rate, is at least 10% different from the
discounted remaining cash flows of the original financial liability.
Qualitatively the modification is non-substantial because there has
been no change in the counterparty to the loan and a quantitative
assessment has been performed. The modification in 2017 is non-
substantial, or less than 10% of the net present value of the original
loan balance, with the net present value of the changes being a
$31 million reduction in cash flows or 0.9% over the life of the loan.
This adjustment is recognised as a gain in other income and will be
unwound as an interest expense on an effective interest rate basis
with immediate unwinds occurring on loan repayments. The unwind
for the year ending 31 December 2017 would have been $7 million
which included an immediate unwind associated with the repayment
of US$150 million of the facilities in December 2017.
As the Group is applying AASB 9 retrospectively with the cumulative
effect of initially applying the standard as an adjustment to the opening
balance of retained earnings, accordingly comparative financial
information is not being restated. The adjustment to the balance
sheet and profit or loss for the year ended 31 December 2017 is
outlined below:
