6.	 Non-Executive Director fees
Objective
The Board seeks to set remuneration for Non-Executive Directors
at a level which:
––
provides the Company with the ability to attract and retain
Directors of the highest calibre;
––
reflects the responsibilities and demands made on
Non‑Executive Directors; and
––
is reasonable and acceptable to the Company’s shareholders.
Structure
The remuneration structure for the Non-Executive Directors is distinct
from the remuneration structure for Executives in line with sound
corporate governance.
The Company set an aggregate remuneration cap of $3,500,000
per annum for all Non-Executive Directors. Consistent with the
Constitution, remuneration payable to each Non-Executive Director
has been approved by the Company’s majority shareholder, Yanzhou.
The total Board and Committee fees paid by the Company to Non-
Executive Directors in 2018 was $985,499.
During 2018, Non-Executive Directors were remunerated by way of
fixed fees in the form of cash and superannuation (to the maximum
superannuation guarantee cap). A change was made to the Board
and Board Committee fees from 2017 to 2018 with the Independent
Co‑Vice Chairman’s remuneration increasing to $330,000. No equity
instruments were issued to Non-Executive Directors over 2018 as
part of their remuneration package. No element of the Non-Executive
Director fees is linked to performance.
Neither Board nor Board Committee fees were paid to:
––
Executive Directors Baocai Zhang and Fucun Wang as the
responsibilities of Board Committee membership are considered
in determining the remuneration provided as part of their normal
employment conditions.
––
Nominee Directors of Yanzhou as the responsibilities of Board or
Board Committee membership were considered part of their role
and remuneration arrangements with their nominating company.
The Directors of Yanzhou and China Cinda (HK) Holdings Company
Limited Group (“Cinda”) were as follows:

Xiyong Li
