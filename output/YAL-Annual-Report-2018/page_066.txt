REMUNERATION REPORT – AUDITED
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to introduce the Yancoal Australia Ltd (the “Company”)
and its controlled entities (the “Group” or “Yancoal”) 2018
Remuneration Report.
The Company has continued its transition from a loss-making
enterprise to profit-generating enterprise. Further, in 2018 Yancoal
achieved a major milestone becoming dual listed on the main board of
The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong.
Consequently, over 2018 the Nomination and Remuneration
Committee continued to review the Company’s remuneration
framework to ensure remuneration arrangements were in line with
sound corporate governance for an Australian and Hong Kong listed
company and for a company of its size.
In 2018, the Committee engaged the consulting firm Aon
Hewitt Limited (“Aon Hewitt”) to provide independent market
benchmarking with respect to the remuneration of Yancoal
executives and non-executive directors. This included providing
remuneration recommendations to better align management with
shareholder interests.
Taking into account the Aon Hewitt recommendations and in order to
maintain executive remuneration arrangements that are competitive,
consistent with contemporary market practice and tailored to align
with Yancoal’s short-term and long-term strategic objectives, the
Board has implemented a new Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)
during the year and amended the existing Short Term Incentive
Plan (“STIP”). These changes have been outlined in Section 3 of
this report. The key changes aimed to also strengthen shareholder
alignment include:
STIP: 50% of the STIP award will now be deferred over a two-year
period (25% deferred for one year, remaining 25% deferred for two
years). These deferrals will be settled in either cash or equity.
LTIP: In addition to the service condition, LTIP grants for 2018 will
also be subject to performance hurdles (measured over a three-year
period) to assess vesting. Awards will be delivered in performance
share rights instead of cash.
The new plans were developed to reward short-term and long-
term performance and are delivered in cash and equity to further
strengthen shareholder alignment.
This report sets out remuneration information for the Company’s Key
Management Personnel for the 12 months ended 31 December 2018.
Yours sincerely,
Helen Jane Gillies
Chair of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee
