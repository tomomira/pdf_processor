      "text_content": "ASSETS AND GROWTH\nThrough 2018 Yancoal consolidated the high\nquality assets secured in late 2017 through the\nCoal & Allied transaction.\nYancoal anticipates demand for its high quality\nlow-sulphur coal to remain healthy through 2019.\nIn combination with a constrained market supply\nresponse for these products, this should result\nin premiums the Company can achieve through\nthe year.\nIn the year ahead, Yancoal will continue\nthe exploration, expansion and optimisation\nefforts across the three tier-one assets of\nMount Thorley Warkworth, Moolarben and\nHunter Valley Operations.\nKey projects include an underground mine\nconcept at Mount Thorley Warkworth.\nThe underground mine could add six million\ntonnes per annum of raw coal production.\nExploration drilling for the pre-feasibility\non the target seams concluded in late 2018.\nAt Moolarben, mine plan modifications could add\na further six million tonnes per annum of raw coal\nproduction to the production profile. It is through\noptimisation of the approved operations that this\nwould be achieved.\nAt the third tier-one asset, Hunter Valley\nOperations, Yancoal continues to work with\njoint venture partner Glencore Coal to implement\na strategic review of existing operational,\nmaintenance and fleet efficiencies. The focus\nis on delivering operational synergies identified\nduring the joint venture transaction. This project\ncontributes to the ongoing operating cost\ncontrol efforts.\nYancoal will continue its drive towards\nincreased production and cost efficiency.\nExpansion and extension projects across\nits tier-one assets combined with ongoing cost\nminimising efforts underpin future cash flow.\nOutside the existing assets, Yancoal remains\nopen to strategic acquisitions.\nOUR\nOUTLOOK\nBlending of our coal products to meet evolving\nmarket conditions is an ongoing opportunity to\nmaximise the revenue potential of our asset base.\nThe aim is to combine coals of various qualities\nand characteristics to achieve a higher average\nrealised price.\nGUIDANCE\nOur focus is on the controllable operational factors\nthat drive the financial outcomes. In 2019 the\ncompany intends to increase its production while\nmaintaining steady operating costs.\nThe guidance for saleable coal production in 2019\nis approximately 35 million tonnes (attributable),\nup from 32.9 million tonnes in 2018. The majority\nof the output will come from the three tier-one\nassets, Mount Thorley Warkworth, Moolarben\nand Hunter Valley Operations (in 2018 it was\n90% of 32.9 million tonnes).\nYancoal will maintain strong cost discipline, with\n2019 cash costs (excluding Government royalties)\nexpected to remain flat at around A$62.5/t (2018:\nA$63/t)1. Yancoal continues to secure efficiency\ngains from the assets acquired in 2017; this enables\nthe flat operating cost forecast despite the broader\nindustry cost pressure.\nForecast capital expenditure for 2019 is around\nA$285 million (attributable); this is consistent\nwith prior three years, despite the increased\noperational production profile.\n1 \u0007Operating cash costs exclude Government royalties.\n2019e is an estimate for the forward period.\n6         YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD",

We maintain our\nposition that we never compromise on safety.\nHK LISTING\nIn 2018 we strengthened our shareholder base\nvia Yancoal’s successful listing on the Main Board\nof The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Ltd.\nAs an established leader within the global resources\nsector, our Hong Kong listing is an important step\nforward in the Company’s history. Yancoal is now\nthe only dual-listed Australian/Hong Kong coal\noperator and our listing will provide further\nopportunities to drive share price improvement\nand improve Yancoal’s liquidity.\nYancoal also raised A$268 million as part of the\nGlobal Offering associated with the Company’s\nHK listing, with the net proceeds raised to be\nused to repay debt and unsecured loans; finance\npotential acquisitions; and for working capital and\ngeneral corporate purposes. Proceeds raised were\nalso used to finance the acquisition of an additional\n4% interest in Moolarben in December 2018.\nOUTLOOK\nIn the year ahead, Yancoal Australia remains focused\non delivering high quality thermal and metallurgical\ncoal to meet increasing global demand; and\ndeveloping its pipeline of major projects.\nWe have high expectations for our future growth,\nand remain committed to leading by example\nand operating in accordance with the values\nof the Yancoal Way, guided by our core beliefs\nof compliance, transparency and efficiency.\nAs we continue to support the development\nof a low-emissions future, coal remains a critical\npart of global baseload energy supply needs.\nIt is therefore our responsibility to operate efficiently\nand transparently to ensure only the highest grades\nof quality coal are being produced and exported\nto meet future low-emission, high-energy needs\nin the international market.\nDemand for both thermal and metallurgical coal\nis expected to continue to grow in 2019, and\nI believe this year’s financial and operational results\nclearly demonstrate we have the resilience, skills\nand strength to maximise future opportunities.\nTogether, with the support of our majority\nshareholders, the Board and Executive, and\noperational leadership teams, I believe we will\ngenerate further success for Yancoal Australia\nand value for investors.\n2019 will be a year of new opportunities and I look\nforward to the road ahead as an integral participant\nin our key markets.\n1 \u0007As announced 25 February 2019.\nANNUAL REPORT 2018         9",

The\nincreased production base, strong commodity\npricing and stable operating costs all contributed\nto this compelling outcome. The robust cash flow\nenables Yancoal to pursue several initiatives\nconcurrently.\nThe first stage in the capital allocation cycle\nis to concurrently meet the primary obligations.\nREINVESTMENT\n– PRIMARY OBLIGATION #1\nFuture operating cash flow depends upon the\nassets delivering the availability and utilisation\ntargets. Reinvesting in the operations and\nequipment is essential to this. The forecast capital\nand sustaining expenditure in 2019 is $285 million;\nthis is less than the prior three-year average as the\nequipment upgrade cycle and expansion project\nrequired higher levels of capital in previous years\nbut has reduced the near-term burden.\nDIVIDEND RETURNS\n– PRIMARY OBLIGATION #2\nThe Board provides shareholders with direct\nexposure to the Company’s performance via an\nNet Profit After Tax (NPAT) based distribution.\nIn 2018 the total Dividend allocation was $507\nmillion; including the special dividend this was\na payout ratio of ~60% from Net Profit After Tax.\nThe 2019 target is a 50% NPAT payout ratio1.\nThe next stage of the capital cycle is consideration\nof the discretionary opportunities. The Board\nseeks to balance the relative merits of each\nagainst the other.\nDEBT REDUCTION\n– DISCRETIONARY PURSUIT #1\nThe rapid reduction of debt is something the\nCompany continues to deliver. US$1.4 billion\nin debt has been repaid ahead of schedule since\nthe Coal & Allied transaction in late 2017. The debt\nrepayment brought the gearing ratio down to 35%\nat the end of December2, and the Leverage Ratio\ndown to 1.4x3. Yancoal intends to continue making\nearly repayments to reduce its debt position and\noptimise existing loan facilities; particularly in the\ncoming year given the coal price outlook.\nGROWTH OPPORTUNITIES\n– DISCRETIONARY PURSUIT #2\nYancoal has identified 12 million tonnes of\nadditional annual production to pursue within its\nexisting asset base. The internal expansion provides\na pathway for boosting operating cash flow.\nThe Coal & Allied transaction demonstrated that\nexternal growth could also be tremendously\nsuccessful – it transformed the Company in 2018.\nExamining opportunities for corporate acquisitions\nis an ongoing effort, but growth must be accretive.\nIn the Capital Allocation Cycle, Asset Reinvestment\nand Growth Opportunities support the future\ncycles, Dividends reward the investors, and Debt\nReduction improves the capacity for all other steps.\n1 \u0007The NPAT used will be adjusted for foreign exchange, hedge reserve\nmovements and non-operating items as determined by the Directors.\n2 \u0007Gearing calculated as Net Debt divided by the sum of Net Debt and Equity.\n3 \u0007Leverage Ratio calculated as Net Debt divided by Operating EBITDA.\nNet Debt does not include the debt associated with Watagan.\nYANCOAL CAPITAL ALLOCATION CYCLE – PRIORITISES CAPITAL RETURNS\nAND ASSET REINVESTMENT\nYANCOAL CAPITAL ALLOCATION CYCLE – PRIORITISES CAPITAL RETURNS\nAND ASSET REINVESTMENT\nANNUAL REPORT 2018         11",

A 74%\nuplift in the sales volume and a 16% increase\nin the average sale price drove the strong\nrevenue performance.\nThe Operating Cash Costs increased by less than\n2% to $63/t. Including royalties and the non-cash\ndepreciation and amortisation charges, the Total\nProduction Costs increased by less than 5% to\n$89/t. These costs compare to an average sale\nprice of $132/t across all the coal sold.\nOPERATING EBITDA AND OPERATING\nEBITDA MARGIN\nOperating EBITDA increased by 121% from\n$988 million in 2017 to $2,180 million in 2018.\nThe EBITDA flows directly from the higher\nrevenue with a modest offset from the cash\ncosts (A$73/t including royalties). Consequently,\nOperating EBITDA margin as a percentage of\nOperating Revenue increased from 36% in 2017\nto 45% in 2018.\nDEPRECIATION AND AMORTISATION\nDepreciation and amortisation expenses increased\nby 104% from $256 million in 2017 to $523 million\nin 2018. The increase primarily stemmed from the\nincreased asset base following the Coal & Allied\nacquisition. On a per tonne basis, the depreciation\nand amortisation costs increased from $14/t to\n$16/t in 2018.\nNET FINANCE COSTS\nNet finance costs decreased by 4% from $282\nmillion in 2017 to $270 million in 2018, primarily\ndue to the ongoing voluntary loan repayments.\nINCOME TAX EXPENSE\nIt is important to note that the Company did\nnot pay any cash tax in 2018; this is due to tax\nlosses carried forward from prior years. There\nare further tax losses to be utilised in future years.\nFor accounting purposes, the Income tax expense\nwas $320 million in 2018, and the effective tax rate\nwas 27.3%.\nNET PROFIT AFTER TAX\nThese elements combined to deliver a profit after\nincome tax that increased 272% from $229 million\nin 2017 to $852 million in 2018.\nTotal Revenue increased by 86% from\n$2,601 million in 2017 to $4,891 million\nin 2018.

As higher grades of coal quality remain\nin tight supply, the premiums captured by suppliers\nshould remain supported during 2019.\nAsia remains a dynamic market, with coal currently\nrepresenting over 50% of the Asian energy\nrequirement and it remains the cheapest energy\nsource for developing nations. China continues\nto introduce an alternative energy policy, but it also\nneeds the certainty of a baseload energy supply.\nThe middle ground sees Chinese buyers seeking\nhigher CV and low-sulphur coals, as focus shifts\ntowards a more significant proportion of import\ncoals with an energy level higher than 5,000 kCal/\nkg NAR. This scenario is constructive for the price\noutlook on Yancoal thermal coal products.\nStatistics indicate Australia will continue to retain\na market share of approximately 26% of the\ngrowing world seaborne thermal coal requirement1.\nAs Australia’s largest pure-play coal producer\nYancoal is well positioned to participate in the\nseaborne market.\nYancoal has a diverse customer base by\ngeography. In 2018 no one country contributed\nmore than 22% of the revenue generated by the\nCompany. This customer split provides insulation\nfrom regional demand disruption should it occur.\n1 Based on research and commentary from Wood Mackenzie.\nSource: S&P Global Platts, globalCOAL.\nPercentage of revenue by region 2017 to 2018\nPremium percentage of Newcastle coal exports\nANNUAL REPORT 2018         17",

Total new disturbance\nacross all operations in 2018 was 242 hectares.\nAs of 31 December 2018, Yancoal has seeded\nand planted 53% of disturbed areas across\nall operations1.\nGREENHOUSE GAS AND\nENERGY DATA REPORTING\nREQUIREMENTS\nAs Australia’s largest pure-play thermal coal\nproducer, Yancoal acknowledges it has a role\nto play in mitigating the emissions generated\nby its operations and supporting investment into\nlow-emission technology to assist the reduction\nof downstream emissions from the consumption\nof coal products.\nThe Company also understands the growing\ninterest by stakeholders regarding the potential\nrisks and opportunities posed to our business and\nthe broader sector as a result of an anticipated\nglobal shift towards a lower-carbon economy.\nRecognising this, the Board continues to\nconsider the adoption of the Taskforce on\nClimate‑related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”)\nRecommendations, established by the G20\nFinancial Stability Board, as the framework\nto guide our climate-related disclosures.\nNational Greenhouse Energy Reporting (NGER)*\nThe considerations include the desire for greater\ntransparency in the way we identify and mitigate\npotential risks posed by changes to our external\nenvironment from policy, legal, market demand,\nreputational and technological perspectives.\nGOVERNANCE\nThe Board regularly considers how climate\nchange may drive changes to physical, regulatory,\ncommercial and operating environments to inform\nthe development of medium- to long-term goals\nand strategies.\nREPORTING ON EMISSIONS\nYancoal reports its operational direct (Scope 1)\nand indirect (Scope 2) emissions on an annual basis\nin line with the National Greenhouse and Energy\nReporting legislation. The Group has implemented\nsystems and processes for the collection and\ncalculation of the data required by the Federal\nClean Energy Regulator.\nOverall, on an operational control basis, our total\nScope 1 and Scope 2 emissions for the period\nended 30 June 2018 totalled 1.96 million tCO2-e,\nless than a 1% increase on the year prior. The\nmajority of Scope 1 emissions relate to fugitive\nemissions associated with the underground and\nopen cut mining operations, while Scope 2\nemissions stem from the consumption of electricity\npurchased from the grid.\nWhile we do not currently calculate Scope 3\nemissions associated with the consumption\nof our coal products, we actively support the\ndevelopment of technologies aimed at reducing\nthe emissions intensity of these downstream\nactivities. This stance includes supporting the\nconstruction or installation of high-efficiency,\nlow-emissions technologies in coal-fired power\nstations and investment in carbon capture and\nstorage technology.\nANNUAL REPORT 2018         19",

Yancoal’s contracted capacity\nis 1.5Mt per annum, allocated to the Yarrabee Mine.\n1 All numbers are on an equity basis.\nRAIL\nYancoal is supported by the following rail networks\nto transport product from mine to port:\n•\t The NSW Hunter Valley Coal Chain: supporting\nthe Moolarben, Mount Thorley Warkworth,\nHunter Valley Operations, Austar, Ashton,\nStratford Duralie, and Donaldson operations,\nwith coal transported to the Port of Newcastle;\n•\t The QLD Blackwater System: supporting\nthe Yarrabee operation, transporting coal\nto the Port of Gladstone; and\n•\t The QLD Goonyella System: supporting\nthe Middlemount operation, with coal\ntransported to the Port of Hay Point and\nAbbot Point Coal Terminal.\n2018 TAKE-OR-PAY1\nYancoal’s unutilised take-or-pay exposure\nincreased from the year prior (2017: $60.7 million;\nequity basis) to $84.9 million in rail and port\ncommitments in excess of shipped sales.\nThe increase of $24.2 million was attributable\nto the take-or-pay exposure acquired from the\nformer Coal & Allied assets (full year $32.9 million)\nand under-utilisation of WICET port capacity\n($7.9 million). This was offset by a $16.6 million\nreduction from increased utilisation by Moolarben\nand trading with third parties.\nYancoal continues to implement strategic measures\nto reduce take-or-pay exposure across the Group\nby trading between sites and with other users.\nANNUAL REPORT 2018         29",

Ltd, BOCI Financial Products Limited and United NSW\nEnergy Limited. Under the arrangement, Yancoal’s interests in the assets of Ashton, Austar and Donaldson were transferred to and held by Watagan.\n(5)\t Coal Reserves have been depleted from the previous reporting period due to ongoing studies and investigations in the Stage 3 area during 2018. Austar was subject to\nprohibition notices issued by the Resource Regulator that restricted current operations in Bellbird South and investigations by the Resource Regulator are continuing.\nOngoing work is being undertaken by Watagan in respect of the very challenging geological and geotechnical conditions at the Austar mine, including both the Bellbird\nSouth and Stage 3 areas that may have a significant adverse impact on future commercial operations. The future prospects of the Austar mine are therefore uncertain, and\nwill depend upon the work currently being conducted by Watagan and its internal and external advisers. If it is determined that the mine is unable to return to previously\nforecast levels of production, there may be a need to proceed to a permanent shutdown.

      "text_content": "MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n40      YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nYancoal operates a diversified portfolio of world class assets\nconsisting of both large-scale open cut and underground mines\ncomprising five coal mine complexes in Australia.\nAs a leading low-cost coal producer in the global seaborne market,\nYancoal’s coal mining operations produce a mix of premium thermal,\nsemi-soft coking, and pulverised coal injection (PCI) coals, together\nwith mid-to high-ash thermal coals.\nThe Group’s financial results are largely dependent on the demand\nfor thermal and metallurgical coal, which in turn depends on\nmacroeconomic trends, including regional and global economic activity,\nand the price and availability of alternative forms of energy production.\nOur customers are located throughout the Asia-Pacific region with\nJapan, Singapore, China, South Korea and Taiwan accounting for\napproximately 81% of our revenue from coal sales in the year ended\n31 December 2018.\nThermal coal is primarily used in electricity generation and its end\nusers are typically power and utilities companies. Metallurgical coal is\nprimarily used to produce coke for blast furnace steel production and\nits end users are typically steel plants. We also sell coal to customers\nin the commodities trading business, who purchase the Group’s coal\nfor trading purposes or to on-sell to their end customers. Commodity\ntraders are similarly exposed to regional and global demand trends in\nthe coal market.\nThe Group’s export thermal coal is generally priced on either an index\nprice, an annual fixed price or on a spot price basis. Generally, lower\nash products are priced relative to the GlobalCOAL Newcastle index\nand higher ash products are priced relative to the Argus/McCloskey\nAPI5 index. Annual fixed price contracts are mostly priced against the\nJapanese Power Utility (JPU) reference price, which is the contract price\nagreed between major Australian suppliers and Japanese power utilities.\nThe balance of our sales are priced on a fixed spot price negotiated at\nthe time of settlement that also reflects the terms of the arrangement.\nThe Group’s export metallurgical coal is either priced on a benchmark\nor spot price basis. Most term contracts are priced against a\nbenchmark pricing mechanism which is negotiated on a quarterly\nbasis between major Australian suppliers and Japanese steel mills.\nSpot sales are priced relative to the market at the time and are\nmostly done on a fixed price basis. The large majority of the Group’s\nsemi-soft coking coal out of Newcastle and low volatile PCI out of\nQueensland is priced relative to the quarterly benchmark.\nThe Group’s coal sales revenue is typically recognised on a Free on\nBoard (FOB) basis when coal is loaded at the load port in Australia.\nThe Group’s overall average selling price of coal increased by 16%\nfrom A$114 per tonne in 2017 to A$132 per tonne in 2018, mainly as\na result of the increase in global coal market prices during this period,\nincluding low-ash thermal coal prices increasing by approximately\nUS$19 per tonne and semi-soft metallurgical coal prices increasing\nby approximately US$15 per tonne. The Group’s average selling price\nof thermal coal increased from A$102 per tonne to A$123 per tonne,\nwhile the average selling price of metallurgical coal increased from\nA$165 per tonne to A$182 per tonne.\nThe Group’s overall average cash operating costs excluding\ngovernment royalties increased from A$62 per tonne in 2017 to\nA$63 per tonne in 2018 primarily due to an increase in raw materials\nand consumables used due to an increase in diesel costs of 123%,\nprimarily due to increased market prices for diesel fuel and larger\ntruck fleets at the acquired Coal & Allied Industries Limited (C&A)\nmines. The Group’s overall cash operating costs including government\nroyalties increased from A$71 per tonne in 2017 to A$73 per tonne\nin 2018 with the increase in royalties driven by higher coal prices.\nThe table below sets out the Run of Mine (ROM) and saleable\nproduction for each Yancoal owned mine on a 100% basis during\nthe Group’s period of ownership.\nOwnership\n%(1)\nYear ended 31 December\nChange\n%\n2018\nMt\n2017\nMt(2)\nROM production\nMoolarben\n85%\n18.6\n14.7\n27%\nMTW\n82.9%\n17.6\n5.8\n203%\nHVO\n51%\n19.0\n6.2\n206%\nStratford Duralie\n100%\n0.7\n0.9\n(22%)\nYarrabee\n100%\n3.4\n3.4\n–\nMiddlemount\n~50%\n4.8\n5.3\n(9%)\nWatagan\n100%\n2.4\n4.8\n(50%)\nTotal – 100% basis\n66.5\n41.1\n62%\nSaleable production\nMoolarben\n85%\n16.5\n12.4\n33%\nMTW\n82.9%\n12.1\n3.9\n210%\nHVO\n51%\n13.3\n4.8\n177%\nStratford Duralie\n100%\n0.5\n0.7\n(29%)\nYarrabee\n100%\n2.6\n2.8\n(7%)\nMiddlemount\n~50%\n3.8\n3.9\n(3%)\nWatagan\n100%\n1.2\n3.0\n(60%)\nTotal – 100% basis\n50.0\n31.5\n59%\n(1)\t Ownership percentage stated as at 31 December 2018.\n(2)\t 2017 only includes four months of production for the unincorporated MTW and HVO joint ventures from 1 September 2017.",

This included an increase in the three tier-one assets of\nMoolarben, MTW and HVO of 99% from 21.1Mt in 2017 to 41.9Mt in 2018.\nMoolarben’s ROM production increased by 3.9Mt (27%) and its saleable production increased by 4.1Mt (33%) with all the increase in ROM\nattributable to a full year’s production from the underground mine of 5.6Mt (2017: 1.7Mt). The further increase in saleable production was\nattributable to an improved yield due to the underground coal being 100% bypass.\nThe increases at MTW and HVO were primarily attributable to a full year of production in 2018 compared to only the last four months of 2017.\nThe table below sets out the Group’s ongoing economic interest in the saleable production for each Yancoal owned mine that contributes to the\nfinancial results of the Group; i.e. excludes Watagan.\nOwnership\n%(1)\nYear ended 31 December\n2018\nMt(3)\n2017\nMt(2)(3)\nChange\n%\nSaleable production\nMoolarben\n85%\n13.3\n10.1\n32%\nMTW\n82.9%\n9.7\n2.5\n288%\nHVO\n51%\n6.8\n2.4\n183%\nStratford Duralie\n100%\n0.5\n0.7\n(29%)\nYarrabee\n100%\n2.6\n2.8\n(7%)\n32.9\n18.5\n78%\nMiddlemount (equity-accounted)\n~50%\n1.9\n1.9\n–\nTotal – equity basis\n34.8\n20.4\n71%\nThermal\n27.3\n14.7\n86%\nMetallurgical\n7.5\n5.7\n32%\n34.8\n20.4\n71%\n(1)\t Ownership percentage stated as at 31 December 2018.\n(2)\t 2017 only includes four months of production for the unincorporated MTW and HVO joint ventures from 1 September 2017.\n(3)\t Includes saleable production of (i) 81% of the Moolarben unincorporated joint venture up to and including 30 November 2018 and 85% thereafter; (ii) 51% of\nthe unincorporated HVO joint venture representing the Group’s ongoing economic interest; (iii) 64.1% of the unincorporated MTW joint venture up to and including\n28 February 2018 and 82.5% thereafter; (iv) 100% of Yarrabee and Stratford Duralie; and (v) ~50% of Middlemount although equity-accounted.\nThe Group’s saleable coal production, excluding Middlemount, was up 78% from 18.5Mt in 2017 to 32.9Mt in 2018 and including Middlemount\nwas up 71% from 20.4Mt in 2017 to 34.8Mt in 2018.

The Group’s average selling price of\nthermal coal increased from A$102 per tonne to A$123 per tonne, while its average selling price of metallurgical coal increased from A$165\nper tonne to A$182 per tonne. Ex-mine thermal sales represented 85% of total ex-mine sales volume in 2018; an increase from 80% in 2017.\nThere was an increase in our ex-mine sales volume of coal of 74% from 19.3Mt in 2017 to 33.5Mt in 2018, mainly due to (a) the full year effect\nof the C&A Acquisition from 1 September 2017; (b) the Other acquisitions and disposals completed during 2018; and (c) the expansion of\nMoolarben from 10.2Mt in 2017 to 13.5Mt (equity) in 2018.\nYear ended 31 December\n2018\n2017\nAmount\n$’m\n% of revenue\n%\nAmount\n$’m\n% of revenue\n%\nJapan\n1,055\n22%\n489\n19%\nSingapore\n861\n18%\n337\n13%\nChina\n739\n16%\n654\n25%\nSouth Korea\n664\n14%\n415\n16%\nTaiwan\n518\n11%\n131\n5%\nThailand(1)\n343\n7%\n85\n3%\nAustralia(1)\n295\n6%\n237\n9%\nOthers(2)\n265\n6%\n275\n10%\nTotal revenue from external customers\n4,740\n100%\n2,623\n100%\n(1)\t 2017 includes the reclassification of $85 million of revenue on the BLCP contract from Australia to Thailand.\n(2)\t Others includes Malaysia, Germany, Vietnam, India and Switzerland.\nThe Group achieved an increase in revenue from external customers across each of its key geographic markets. In particular, substantial\nincreases in revenue from 2017 to 2018 from (i) $489 million to $1,055 million in Japan, (ii) $337 million to $861 million in Singapore,\n(iii) $415 million to $664 million in South Korea and (iv) $131 million to $518 million in Taiwan. The increases in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan\nwere primarily attributable to the C&A Acquisition, with the quality of coal from the HVO and MTW mines being suitable for these typically higher\npriced markets.\nThe increase in the PRC was primarily due to efforts to increase sales of the Group’s higher-ash products to end users in the PRC.\nThe increase in Thailand was attributable to the full year effect of a long-term supply contract acquired as part of the C&A Acquisition.",

In addition, diesel costs increased\nby 123%, primarily due to increased market prices for diesel fuel and larger truck fleets at the acquired C&A mines. This contributed to an\nincrease in per ex-mine sales tonne raw materials and consumables used from $18 to $20 over the same period.\nEmployee benefits\nEmployee benefits expenses increased by 72% from $302 million in 2017 to $518 million in 2018, primarily due to the increase in overall\nheadcount as a result of the C&A Acquisition and the Moolarben expansion. Per ex-mine sales tonne employee benefits expenses remained\nflat at $16 over the same period.\nTransportation\nTransportation costs increased by 72% from $312 million in 2017 to $537 million in 2018, primarily due to increased sales volume of\ncoal requiring additional payments for rail and freight services.

Royalties are determined on an\nad valorem basis by reference to the value of coal sold, the type of\nmine and the State the mine is located in and are payable to the\nappropriate State Government. This contributed to an increase in\nper ex-mine sales tonne government royalties from $9 to $10 over\nthe same period.\nCoal purchases\nCoal purchases decreased by 2% from $340 million in 2017 to\n$332 million in 2018. Coal purchases as a percentage of operating\nrevenue decreased from 13% to 7% over the same period, primarily\ndue to a relatively lower amount of coal blending being undertaken\non the C&A sales while we continue to evaluate and adjust to C&A’s\ncustomer relationships and their coal quality needs.\nOther operating expenses\nOther operating expenses increased by 37% from $54 million in 2017\nto $74 million in 2018, primarily as a result of the C&A Acquisition\nand Moolarben expansion.\nShare of profit of equity-accounted investees, net of tax\nShare of profit of equity-accounted investees, net of tax increased\nby 75% from $32 million in 2017 to $56 million in 2018 primarily\ndue to the improved profit after tax performance of the incorporated\nMiddlemount joint venture. The Group’s equity-accounted investment\nin Watagan is held on the balance sheet at nil value such that the loss\nafter tax of the Watagan Group of $217 million for the year ended\n31 December 2018 is not reflected in the Group’s Statement of profit\nand loss for the same period.\nOperating EBITDA and operating EBITDA margin\nOperating EBITDA increased by 121% from $988 million in 2017\nto $2,180 million in 2018 primarily due to an 80% increase in\noperating revenue partially offset by an increase in cash operating\ncosts (including royalties) from $71 to $73 per tonne over the same\nperiod. Operating EBITDA margin as a percentage of operating\nrevenue increased from 36% in 2017 to 45% in 2018.\nDepreciation and amortisation\nDepreciation and amortisation expenses increased by 104%\nfrom $256 million in 2017 to $523 million in 2018, primarily due\nto an increase in mining tenements and plant and equipment of\n$2,456 million and $1,326 million, respectively, from the C&A\nAcquisition, together with expansionary capital incurred at Moolarben.\nPer ex-mine sales tonne depreciation and amortisation costs\nincreased from $14 to $16 over the same period.\nOperating EBIT and operating EBIT margin\nOperating EBIT increased by 126% from $732 million in 2017 to\n$1,657 million in 2018 primarily due to an 80% increase in operating\nrevenue partially offset by an increase in cash operating costs\n(including royalties) from $71 to $73 per tonne and an increase in\ndepreciation and amortisation from $14 to $16 per tonne over the\nsame period. Operating EBIT margin as a percentage of operating\nrevenue increased from 27% in 2017 to 34% in 2018.\nNet finance costs\nNet finance costs decreased by 4% from $282 million in 2017\nto $270 million in 2018, primarily due to (i) an overall reduction in\ninterest-bearing liabilities during 2018 compared to 2017 following\nseveral voluntary loan repayments and (ii) a reduction in the Yanzhou\nguarantee fee provided on the Group’s syndicated facility being\npartially offset by (i) an increase in LIBOR during the year from\nan average of 1.17% in 2017 to an average of 2.43% in 2018\nand (ii) a decrease in the A$:US$ exchange rate resulting in an\nincrease in the Australian dollar finance charge. Net finance costs\nas a percentage of operating revenue decreased from 9% to 6%\nover the same period, primarily due to the C&A Acquisition being\nequity‑funded, which reduced the Group’s overall gearing levels.\nProfit before income tax and profit before income tax margin\nAs a result of the aforementioned reasons, profit before income tax\nincreased by 277% from $311 million in 2017 to $1,172 million in\n2018. Profit before income tax margin as a percentage of operating\nrevenue increased from 11% to 24% over the same period.\nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense increased by 290% from $82 million in 2017\nto $320 million in 2018. The effective tax rate was 26.4% and 27.3%\nin the same years, respectively, which is lower than the Australian\ncorporate income tax rate of 30%. In 2018 the lower effective tax rate\nprimarily resulted from certain non-assessable income items including\nthe Group’s share of equity-accounted profits and part of the gain\non the partial disposal of HVO and an over provision in the prior\nyear. In 2017 the lower effective tax rate also primarily resulted from\ncertain non-assessable income items including the Group’s share of\nequity‑accounted profits and the gain on the C&A Acquisition partially\noffset by non-deductible stamp duty incurred on the C&A Acquisition.\nProfit after income tax and profit after income tax margin\nAs a result of the aforementioned reasons, profit after income tax\nincreased by 272% from $229 million in 2017 to $852 million in 2018.\nProfit after income tax margin as a percentage of operating revenue\nincreased from 8% to 17% over the same period.",

As a consequence, Yankuang\nwill become the bondholder of the put bonds following completion\nof the purchase of those bonds by Yankuang expected to occur\non or around 1 April 2019. No security will be given by Watagan in\nfavour of Yankuang. As the put bonds represent less than 50.1% of\nthe face value of the bonds, and the put option was not exercised\nby the instructing bondholder, the put option is not deemed to have\nbeen exercised as to all the bonds nor has control of Watagan\nbeen regained by the Group such that Watagan continues to\nbe deconsolidated.\nOn 25 February 2019, Yancoal announced a final dividend for the\nfinancial year ended 31 December 2018 of A$377 million (A$0.2855\nper share to be comprised of an ordinary dividend of A$0.1596 and\na special dividend of $0.1259), with a record date of 11 March 2019.\nThe final dividend is expected to be distributed on 30 April 2019.\nAs announced on 25 February 2019, Yancoal will pre-pay a\nfurther US$500 million in loans, reducing its total debt liabilities\nby US$1.4 billion since September 2017.

Export\ncoal sales are denominated in US dollars and a strengthening of\nthe Australian dollar against the US dollar has an adverse impact\non earnings and cash flow settlement. Liabilities for some plant and\nequipment purchases and loans are denominated in currencies other\nthan the Australian dollar and a weakening of the Australian dollar\nagainst other currencies has an adverse impact on earnings and cash\nflow settlement.\nSee Note D9(a)(i) to the financial statements in this report for further\ndetails on foreign currency exposure and a sensitivity analysis of the\nimpact of hypothetical increases and decreases in the Australian dollar\nagainst relevant foreign currencies.",

      "text_content": "MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS      ANNUAL REPORT 2018      51\nPrice Risk\nThe price risk of the Group includes coal price risk.\nThe Group does not enter into commodity contracts other than to\nmeet the Group’s expected usage and sales requirements; and such\ncontracts are not settled net. The royalty receivable from Middlemount\nis exposed to fluctuations in coal price. The Group currently does not\nhave any derivative hedges in place against the movement in the spot\ncoal price.\nSee Note D9(d)(iii) to the financial statements in this report for the\nroyalty receivable coal price sensitivity analysis.\nCoal sales are predominately provisionally priced initially. Provisionally\npriced sales are those for which price finalisation, referenced to\nthe relevant index, is outstanding at the reporting date. Provisional\npricing mechanisms embedded within these sales arrangements\nhave the character of a commodity derivative and are carried at fair\nvalue through profit and loss as part of trade receivables. The final\nsales price is determined normally seven to 90 days after delivery\nto the customer. At 31 December 2018, there were $234 million\nof provisionally priced sales. If prices were to increase by 10%\nprovisionally priced sales would increase by $23 million.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Group is subject to interest rate risk that arises from borrowings\nand cash and cash equivalents. Generally, no variable interest is\nreceivable or payable on the Group’s trade and other receivables or\npayables where applicable as they are fixed in nature and, therefore,\nthey are not exposed to the interest rate risk.\nThe Group’s cash flow interest rate risk for assets primarily arises\nfrom cash at bank and deposits subject to market bank rates. Floating\nrate borrowings bearing LIBOR rates are re-set on a quarterly basis.\nSee Note D9(a)(iii) to the financial statements in this report for a\nsensitivity analysis of the impact of hypothetical increases and\ndecreases in interest rates.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on\nits contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.\nAs at 31 December 2018 the Group’s maximum exposure to credit\nrisk which will cause a financial loss to the Group due to failure to\ndischarge an obligation by the counterparties and financial guarantees\nprovided by the Group arises from the carrying amount of the\nrespective recognised financial assets as stated in the Consolidated\nbalance sheet and the amount of contingent liabilities in relation to\nfinancial guarantees issued by the Group.\nIn order to minimise credit risk, management has delegated a team\nresponsible for determination of credit limits, credit approvals and\nother monitoring procedures to ensure that follow-up action is\ntaken to recover overdue debts. In addition, the Group reviews the\nrecoverable amount of each individual trade debt at the end of the\nreporting period to ensure that adequate impairment losses are made\nfor irrecoverable amounts. In this regard, the Directors consider that\nthe Group’s credit risk is significantly reduced. The Group maintains\nits cash and cash equivalents with reputable banks. Therefore, the\nDirectors consider that the credit risk for such amounts is minimal.\nSee Note D9(b) to the financial statements in this report for further\ndetails on the Group’s credit risk exposure.\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk includes the risk that the Group will not be able to meet\nits financial obligations as they fall due. The Group will be impacted in\nthe following ways:\n(i)\t \u0007will not have sufficient funds to settle transactions on the\ndue date;\n(ii)\t \u0007will be forced to sell financial assets at a value which is less than\nwhat they are worth; or\n(iii)\t \u0007may be unable to settle or recover a financial asset at all.\nLiquidity risk is managed by maintaining sufficient cash and liquid\ndeposit balances and having readily accessible standby facilities in\nplace in accordance with the Board’s risk management policy.\nSee Note D9(c) to the financial statements in this report for further\ndetails on the remaining contractual maturity for the Group’s\nfinancial liabilities.\nCONTINGENT LIABILITIES\nThe contingent liabilities of the Group as at 31 December 2018\ncomprise (i) $875 million of bank guarantees comprising $471 million\nof performance guarantees provided to third parties and $404 million\nof guarantees provided in respect of the cost of restoration of certain\nmining leases given to government departments as required by\nstatute with respect to the Group’s owned and managed mines;\n(ii) a letter of support provided to the Middlemount Coal Pty Limited\njoint venture; and (iii) a number of claims that have been made against\nthe Group, including in respect of personal injuries, and in relation to\ncontracts which Group members are party to as part of the Group’s\nday to day operations.\nSee Note D8 to the financial statements in this report for further details\non the Group’s contingent liabilities.\nCHARGES ON ASSETS\nThe Group has a Syndicated Bank Guarantee Facility provided by\na syndicate of seven Australian and International banks totalling\nA$1 billion. As at 31 December 2018 the facility was drawn to\nA$808 million.\nDuring 2018 five of the seven banks also provided a Syndicated Term\nLoan facility of US$300 million which was fully drawn during the year.\nThe Syndicated Bank Guarantee and Term Loan facilities are\nboth secured by the assets of the consolidated group of Yancoal\nResources Ltd and Coal & Allied Industries Ltd (both wholly\nowned subsidiaries of Yancoal Australia Ltd) with a carrying value\nof $9,486 million as at 31 December 2018.\nFUTURE PROSPECTS\nYancoal will maintain strong cost discipline, with 2019 cash costs\n(excluding government royalties) expected to remain flat at around\nA$62.5/t (2018: A$63/t).\nFor 2019 Yancoal is targeting a dividend payout of 50% of net profit\nafter income tax (adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange hedge\nreserve movements and any other non-operating items).\n2019 guidance for saleable coal production is approximately 35 million\ntonnes (attributable).

This includes supporting\nthe development and installation of high efficiency, low emissions\ntechnologies in coal fired power stations and investment in carbon\ncapture and storage technology.\nSIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE STATE OF AFFAIRS\nThere have been no significant changes to the state of affairs during\nthe financial year that significantly affected the operations of the\nGroup, the results of those operations or the state of affairs of Yancoal\nor the Group.\nMATTERS SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR\nOn 4 January 2019 BOCI notified Watagan and Yankuang that it\nwas exercising its put option over US$200 million of bonds. As a\nconsequence, Yankuang will become the bondholder of the put bonds\nfollowing completion of the purchase of those bonds by Yankuang\nexpected to occur on or around 1 April 2019. No security will be given\nby Watagan in favour of Yankuang. As the put bonds represent less\nthan 50.1% of the face value of the bonds, and the put option was\nnot exercised by the instructing bondholder, the put option is not\ndeemed to have been exercised as to all the bonds nor has control\nof Watagan been regained by the Group such that Watagan continues\nto be deconsolidated.\nOn 25 February 2019, Yancoal announced a final dividend of\nA$377 million (A$0.2855 per share to be comprised of an ordinary\ndividend of A$0.1596 and a special dividend of $0.1259), with a\nrecord date of 11 March 2019. The final dividend and special dividend\nwill be paid on 30 April 2019.\nAs announced 25 February 2019, Yancoal will pre-pay a\nfurther US$500 million in loans, reducing its total debt liabilities\nby US$1.4 billion since September 2017. The pre-payment\nconsists of US$250 million in pre-paid loans from Bank of China\nand China Construction Bank, and US$250 million in pre-paid\nYanzhou‑related loans.\nOn 4 March 2019, Yancoal issued 1,744,704 performance share\nrights (STIP rights) and 1,483,811 performance share rights\n(LTIP rights) to the Executive Director, and certain senior Executives\nof the Company.\nOn 29 March 2019, the Company agreed to enter into four coal sales\nagreements with POSCO Australia Pty Ltd and/or its associates\npursuant to which POSCO and/or its associates have agreed to\npurchase coal from the Group during the financial year ending 31\nDecember 2019. As POSCO is interested in 20% of the Mount\nThorley JV, a subsidiary of the Company under the Listing Rules,\nPOSCO is a connected person of the Company by virtue of being\na substantial shareholder of the Company’s subsidiary. The maximum\nannual transaction amount to be received by the Group from POSCO\nand/or its associates for the sale of coal pursuant to the 2019 POSCO\nSales Agreements for the year ending 31 December 2019 will not\nexceed US$780 million.\nOther than as disclosed above, no matters or circumstances have\noccurred subsequent to the end of the financial period which have\nsignificantly affected, or may significantly affect, the operations of the\nGroup, the results of those operations or the state of affairs of the\nGroup in the subsequent financial period.\nLIKELY DEVELOPMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYancoal continues to pursue its long-term strategy for organic growth\nvia the progression of brownfield expansion and extension projects.\nKey projects include the conceptual underground mine at Mount\nThorley Warkworth with an estimated 6Mtpa ROM, with exploration\ndrilling for the prefeasibility on the target seams having been\ncompleted at the end of 2018.\nYancoal received approvals to commence mining activities associated\nwith the Lot 1 and Lot 2 areas of Mount Thorley Warkworth during the\nreporting period, enabling commencement of the expansion of the\nexisting West pit on the Warkworth side in 2019.\nProposed modifications for the Moolarben open cut pits are awaiting\napproval, as Yancoal continues to maximise improved extraction rates\nin both the open cut and underground mines.\nYancoal will maintain strong cost discipline, with 2019 cash costs\n(excluding government royalties) expected to remain flat at around\nA$62.5/t (2018: A$63/t). Guidance for saleable coal production in\n2019 is approximately 35 million tonnes (attributable).

A previously constituted Independent Board Committee met\non various occasions during 2018 for the purposes of considering transactions between or involving the Company and its major shareholder, Yanzhou.\nREMUNERATION REPORT – AUDITED\nDear Shareholder,\nI am pleased to introduce the Yancoal Australia Ltd (the “Company”)\nand its controlled entities (the “Group” or “Yancoal”) 2018\nRemuneration Report.\nThe Company has continued its transition from a loss-making\nenterprise to profit-generating enterprise. Further, in 2018 Yancoal\nachieved a major milestone becoming dual listed on the main board of\nThe Stock Exchange of Hong Kong.\nConsequently, over 2018 the Nomination and Remuneration\nCommittee continued to review the Company’s remuneration\nframework to ensure remuneration arrangements were in line with\nsound corporate governance for an Australian and Hong Kong listed\ncompany and for a company of its size.\nIn 2018, the Committee engaged the consulting firm Aon\nHewitt Limited (“Aon Hewitt”) to provide independent market\nbenchmarking with respect to the remuneration of Yancoal\nexecutives and non-executive directors. This included providing\nremuneration recommendations to better align management with\nshareholder interests.\nTaking into account the Aon Hewitt recommendations and in order to\nmaintain executive remuneration arrangements that are competitive,\nconsistent with contemporary market practice and tailored to align\nwith Yancoal’s short-term and long-term strategic objectives, the\nBoard has implemented a new Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)\nduring the year and amended the existing Short Term Incentive\nPlan (“STIP”). These changes have been outlined in Section 3 of\nthis report. The key changes aimed to also strengthen shareholder\nalignment include:\nSTIP: 50% of the STIP award will now be deferred over a two-year\nperiod (25% deferred for one year, remaining 25% deferred for two\nyears). These deferrals will be settled in either cash or equity.\nLTIP: In addition to the service condition, LTIP grants for 2018 will\nalso be subject to performance hurdles (measured over a three-year\nperiod) to assess vesting. Awards will be delivered in performance\nshare rights instead of cash.\nThe new plans were developed to reward short-term and long-\nterm performance and are delivered in cash and equity to further\nstrengthen shareholder alignment.\nThis report sets out remuneration information for the Company’s Key\nManagement Personnel for the 12 months ended 31 December 2018.\nYours sincerely,\nHelen Jane Gillies\nChair of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee",

Such advice will typically cover remuneration levels, independent benchmarking data and information regarding\nbest practice, trends and regulatory developments.\nIn 2018, the Committee engaged the consulting firm Aon Hewitt Limited (“Aon Hewitt”) to provide independent market benchmarking with\nrespect to the remuneration of Yancoal executives and non-executive directors. This included providing recommendations, as defined under\nthe Corporations Act 2001, on executive remuneration and executive incentive plan design for the financial year 2018 to the Committee.\nThe Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and Aon Hewitt are satisfied that the recommendations, relating to the executive\nremuneration structure and executive incentive plan design, have not been subject to any undue influence by the Executives to whom the\nrecommendations apply.\nTABLE 2: Remuneration Advisor Fees in 2018\nAon Hewitt\n2018\n$\nRemuneration recommendations\n83,500\nOther advice received\n105,000\nTotal services remuneration\n188,500\n3.\t Executive remuneration\n3.1\tObjective\nRemuneration frameworks for Executives are structured to be market competitive and to reflect the reward strategy of the Company.

      "text_content": "DIRECTORS’ REPORT (CONTINUED)\n70      YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\n3.4\tFixed remuneration\nExecutives receive a Fixed Remuneration package, which incorporates cash salary, superannuation benefits and may include a provision for a\ncar allowance, together with various other benefits. Executives have some scope to determine the combination of cash (including car allowance)\nand various non-monetary benefits by which their FAR is delivered.\nEach Senior Executive’s level of fixed remuneration is reviewed annually to provide a base level of remuneration which is appropriate to the\nposition and competitive with companies of similar size in the mining/resources industry. No Executives are guaranteed an annual increase\nin FAR.\nIn 2018 the Remuneration Committee elected to increase remuneration for certain KMP to ensure remuneration remained competitive and\nconsistent with contemporary market practice following the benchmarking exercise conducted by Aon Hewitt.\n3.5\tVariable remuneration\nVariable remuneration is delivered through participation in the STIP (as outlined in Section 3.5.1) whilst certain Executives are also eligible\nto participate in a LTIP (as outlined in Section 3.5.2).\n3.5.1\nShort Term Incentive Plan\nA new STIP structure was introduced in 2018 that strengthens shareholder alignment and encapsulates performance measures across several\ndifferent metrics. The Board has determined that Company performance goals best encapsulate KMP performance for the 2018 performance\nyear. As such individual performance goals do not form part of the performance metrics for the STIP for 2018 for the executives. The Board\nmaintains discretion to alter the scorecard outcomes outlined below if the scorecard results generate any unintended outcomes from a reward\nperspective considering the perspectives of various stakeholders including but not limited to shareholders, employees and communities.\nEligibility\nThe STIP applies to Executives as well as other management and employees of the Company.\nObjective\nThe objective of the STIP is to reward Executives and employees for the achievements of the Company, Business Unit and individual goals that\nare aligned to the Company’s financial, operational and strategic priorities.\nStructure\nFor 2018 the STIP for KMPs comprised two key components:\n1.\t \u0007STIP Opportunity – this is expressed as a percentage of the Executive’s FAR. The STIP opportunity is reviewed annually. A benchmarking\nexercise is completed against comparable peers in listed companies, and no changes were proposed for 2018. The CEO, CEC, CFO and\nCOO have a Target STIP opportunity of 100% of FAR, with a maximum opportunity of 200% of the Target STIP opportunity. The Board\nbelieves this level of STIP opportunity is reasonable and competitive for the current environment.\n2.\t STIP Scorecard – this consists of several Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”).\n\u0007At the start of each year, KPIs are reviewed and selected by Board as being the most appropriate to the business. Assessment against these\nmeasures is determined following the end of each year.\n\u0007For the Executives named in this report, all KPIs are measured at the Company level. The STIP Scorecard measures the Company’s\nperformance in respect of the following categories:\nKPI\nMeasure\nWeighting\nProfitability\nNet Profit After Tax (“NPAT”)\n30%\nFree On Board (“FOB”) Cash Costs (excluding royalties)\n20%\nRun Of Mine tonnes (“ROM”)\n10%\nHealth and Safety\nTotal Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (“TRIFR”)\n10%\nCritical Controls Compliance\n5%\nStrategic Objectives\nStrategic measures may include special projects, capital management,\ngrowth and culture development\n15%\nEnvironment\nEnvironmental incidents and complaints\n10%\n\u0007STIP scorecard performance is assessed by the Chairman of the Executive Committee and the Chief Executive Officer, reviewed by the\nNomination and Remuneration Committee, and approved by the Board.\nPerformance against the STIP Scorecard is converted to a payout multiplier (calculated referencing the relevant maximum level of opportunity).\nThe payout multiplier is applied to the Target STIP opportunity to determine the actual STIP award. Accordingly, the Executive’s STIP award is\nheavily influenced by the achievement of Company KPIs.\nTiming\nFor any KMP STIP award:\n––\n50% of the award is delivered as a cash payment around April each year.\n––\n50% of the award will vest in equal parts over a two-year period (25% deferred for one year, remaining 25% deferred for two years)\nsubject to continued employment at the respective deferral dates. The deferred STIP will be settled in cash or equity.",

Awards will be delivered in performance share rights and\nwere granted on 30 May 2018.\nThe key characteristics of the LTIP are outlined below:\nTABLE 5: LTIP 2018 Structure\nEligibility\nExecutives and certain senior management are eligible to participate in the LTIP.\nObjective\nThe objective of the LTIP is to reward and retain participants who are in positions to influence the Company’s\nlong-term performance (the LTIP performance period is three years).\nFrequency\nEach year eligible Executives and certain senior management are considered for an annual LTIP grant.\nLTIP opportunity\nThe Chair of the Executive Committee and the Chief Executive Officer have an annual LTIP opportunity\nbetween 100% and 200% of FAR.\nThe Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operations Officer have an LTIP opportunity of between 33% and\n50% of FAR.\nLTIP instrument\nThe LTIP is issued via a grant of performance share rights for nil consideration. The Company may at its\ndiscretion settle an Executive’s and certain senior management’s LTIP in cash or shares.\nLTIP performance conditions\nThe LTIP will vest subject to both service and performance measures over a three-year performance period:\n––\nEarnings Per Share (“EPS”) Vesting Condition (“EPS Awards”): 60% of the award will vest subject to an EPS\ngrowth performance hurdle (“EPS Hurdle”), which compares the EPS performance of the Company with the\nEPS performance of a comparator group of companies operating in the Australian resources sectors over\nthe relevant performance period; and\n––\nCosts Target Vesting Condition (“Costs Awards”): 40% of the award will vest subject to the Company\nachieving a defined cost per tonne target (“Costs Target Hurdle”) over the relevant performance period.\nLTIP performance conditions –\nwhy were they chosen?\nThe EPS Hurdle was chosen because:\na)\t It allows for an objective external assessment of the shareholder value created by the Company relative\nto a group of peers over a sustained period in view of the low liquidity and limited float of Yancoal shares;\nand\nb)\t It is a widely-adopted metric that is well understood by markets.\nThe Costs Target Hurdle was chosen and set at a level which provides a structural incentive to LTI participants\nto ensure that the Company remains positioned in the best cost quartile of Australian coal producers. Further,\nbest quartile costs protect and preserve shareholder value in difficult times and support enhanced returns\nwhen commodity cycles recover.\nHow will the performance\ncondition be calculated for\nthe EPS Hurdle?\nFor the EPS Hurdle, the EPS growth of the Company (based on the Company’s annual report, adjusted for any\nshare consolidations or splits) is measured as a percentile ranking compared to the EPS growth for the same\nperiod of the comparator group of companies operating in the Australian resources sectors.\nThe level of vesting will be determined based on the ranking in accordance with the following schedule:\n––\nat the 75th percentile or above – 100% of the EPS Awards vest;\n––\nbetween the 50th and 75th percentiles – vesting will occur on a pro-rata straight-line basis;\n––\nat 50th percentile – 50% of the EPS Awards vest; and\n––\nbelow the 50th percentile – no EPS Awards vest.\nPerformance Period\n––\nEach EPS Award is capable of vesting and becoming exercisable after a three-year performance period with\nthe performance period commencing on 1 January 2018.\n––\nThe Costs Target Awards is based on the FOB cost per saleable tonne achieved on a Company-wide basis\nfor the year ending 30 December 2020 with Costs Target Awards being tested at, or shortly after, the time\nof publication of the independent expert’s report.\n––\nAll awards that do not vest following testing will lapse immediately. There is no re-testing. All vested awards\nare automatically exercised.\nAllocation Methodology\nThe number of performance rights granted is calculated by dividing the dollar value of the annual LTI\nopportunity by the volume weighted average price of the Company’s ordinary shares traded on the ASX across\na 20-day trading period spread evenly either side of 31 December 2017.\nThe number of performance share rights was adjusted due to the 35:1 share consolidation undertaken by the\nCompany in September 2018.",

As part of this appointment and\nre-appointment process, the Directors consider Board renewal and\nsuccession plans and whether the Board‘s size and composition is\nconducive to making appropriate decisions.\nAt the time of appointment of a new Non-Executive Director, the\nkey terms and conditions relevant to that person’s appointment, the\nBoard’s responsibilities and the Company’s expectations of a Director\nare set out in a letter of appointment. The Company has implemented\nan induction program, facilitated by the Company Secretary, through\nwhich new Non-Executive Directors are introduced to the Company’s\noperations and are familiarised with the Company’s strategy, culture\nand core values.\nThe Board has established a Nomination and Remuneration\nCommittee to make recommendations to the Board on matters such\nas succession plans for the Board, the size and composition of the\nBoard, potential candidates for appointment to the Board, re-election\nof Directors, Board induction and Board evaluation procedures. The\nstructure and membership of the Nomination and Remuneration\nCommittee is described further under Principles 2 and 8.\nThe Board recognises that people are its most important asset and is\ncommitted to the maintenance and promotion of workplace diversity.\nWhilst traditionally experience as a senior Executive or Director of a\nlarge organisation with international operations is a prerequisite for\ncandidature, in accordance with the Diversity Policy, the Board also\nseeks skills and experience in the following areas:\n––\nmarketing and sales;\n––\npolicy and regulatory development and reform;\n––\nhealth, safety and environment and social responsibility; and\n––\nhuman resources.\nIn identifying candidates, the Nomination and Remuneration\nCommittee considers and selects nominees by reference to a number\nof selection criteria including the skills, expertise and background\nthat add to and complement the range of skills, expertise and\nbackground of the existing Directors, the capability of the candidate\nto devote the necessary time and commitment to the role, potential\nconflicts of interest and independence, and the extent to which the\ncandidate would fill a present need on the Board. Where appropriate,\nthe appropriate checks are undertaken prior to a Director being\nappointed. The mix of skills currently held by the Board is set out\nunder Principle 2.\nThe role, rights and responsibilities and membership requirements\nof the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, together with\nthe selection criteria for candidates for the Board, are set out in the\nNomination and Remuneration Committee Charter which can be\nfound within the Corporate Governance section of the Company’s\nwebsite. In carrying out its duties, the Committee has regard to\nthe ASX Principles and the principles in the HK Code, in particular,\nprinciples A.3 and A.4.\nShareholder approval is required for the appointment of Directors.\nHowever, Directors may appoint other Directors to fill a casual\nvacancy where the number of Directors falls below the constitutional\nminimum number of Directors and in order to comply with any\napplicable laws, regulations or the ASX Listing Rules. If a Director\nis appointed to fill a casual vacancy in these circumstances, the\napproval of members must be sought at the next general meeting.\nNo Director may hold office without re-election beyond the third\nannual general meeting (AGM) following the meeting at which the\nDirector was last elected or re-elected. The Company provides all\nmaterial information in its possession in relation to Directors standing\nfor election or re-election in the Notice of Meeting provided to\nshareholders prior to the AGM.\nEach Non-Executive Director has been appointed for an initial term of\nnot more than three years (and will be subject to retirement by rotation\nat least once every three years under Rule 8.1 of the Company’s\nConstitution, pending re-election by the shareholders at an annual\ngeneral meeting). Each Independent Non-Executive Director has been\nappointed for an initial term of not more than three years and will be\nsubject to retirement by rotation at least once every three years under\nRule 8.1 of the Company’s Constitution, pending re-election by the\nshareholders at an annual general meeting.\nTo the extent that the ASX Listing Rules require an election of\nDirectors to be held and no Director would otherwise be required\nunder the Company’s Constitution to submit for election or re-election\nat an AGM, the Director who has been the longest in office since\ntheir last election or appointment must retire at the AGM. As between\nDirectors who were last elected or appointed on the same day, where\nit is not agreed between the relevant Directors, the Director to retire\nmust be decided by lot.\nThe process for appointment, retirement and re-election of Directors\nis set out in the Company’s Constitution which can be found within\nthe Corporate Governance section of the Company’s website.\nDiversity\nThe Company recognises that people are its most important asset\nand is committed to the maintenance and promotion of workplace\ndiversity.

The Diversity Policy is available\nin the Corporate Governance section of the Company’s website.\nAnnually, the Board establishes measurable objectives with the\nassistance of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee with a\nview to progressing towards a balanced representation of women\nat a Board and senior management level.\nThe measurable objectives and performance against them are\nreviewed annually by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee\nas part of its annual review of the effectiveness of the Diversity Policy.\nThe measurable objectives adopted for 2018 and the Company’s\nperformance against the measurable objectives are outlined in the\ntable below:",

The criteria considered in\nassessing the independence of Non‑Executive Directors are also set\nout in the Board Charter.\nA Director is considered independent if the Director:\n––\nis not, and has not within the last three years been, employed in\nan executive capacity by the Company or any of its child entities;\n––\nis not, nor has within the last three years been, a partner, Director\nor senior employee of a provider of material professional services\nto the Company or any of its child entities;\n––\nis not, nor has within the last three years been, in a material\nbusiness relationship with the Company or any of its child entities,\nor an officer of, or otherwise associated with, someone with such\na relationship;\n––\nis not a substantial Shareholder of the Company or an officer\nof, or otherwise associated with, a substantial Shareholder of\nthe Company;\n––\ndoes not have a material contractual relationship with the\nCompany or any of its child entities other than as a Director;\n––\ndoes not have close family ties with any person who falls within\nany of the categories described above;\n––\nhas not been a Director of the Company for such a period that\nhis or her independence may have been compromised; and\n––\nis free from any other interest, position, association or relationship\nthat might interfere, or might reasonably be seen to interfere, with\nthe Director’s capacity to bring an independent judgement to bear\non issues before the Board and to act in the best interests of the\nCompany and its shareholders generally.\nThe Company’s Constitution provides that the Company’s shareholders\nholding a majority of the issued shares of the Company (which confer\nthe right to vote) may nominate a Director to the office of Chairman\nand may elect one or more Directors to the office of Vice Chair.\nAlthough as a nominee of Yanzhou, Baocai Zhang, the Chairman,\nis not considered independent by the independence standard (as\nabove), the Board considers that this is an appropriate reflection of\nYanzhou’s majority shareholding in the Company. While a majority\nof the Directors are associated with Yanzhou this is considered\nappropriate in light of Yanzhou’s major shareholding in the Company.\nBoard skills matrix\nThe Board represents a balance of skills, experience and\ndiversity of perspectives appropriate to the requirements of the\nCompany’s business.\nThe table below sets out the skills and experience that are currently\nrepresented on the Board.\nSkills and Experiences\nTotal\nMining/exploration and production\n4\nEngineering\n4\nCapital projects\n10\nTrading/marketing\n4\nStrategy\n11\nLeadership\n11\nBoard/Committee experience\n8\nCorporate governance\n7\nAccounting/audit/risk management\n7\nGovernment/policy\n9\nLegal/regulatory\n5\nHealth, safety and environment\n6\nHuman resources\n5\nInternational business expertise\n9\nInduction and professional development\nUpon appointment, Directors are provided with an information\npack containing a letter of appointment setting out the Company’s\nexpectations, Directors’ duties and the terms and conditions of their\nappointment, and other materials containing information about the\nCompany including the Company’s Constitution, charters and policies\nto support the induction of Directors to the Board.\nDirectors also participate in continuing education or development\nprograms arranged for them, including for example training on\nDirectors’ duties and developments in workplace health and\nsafety law.\nIn preparation for the HK Listing, all Directors undertook training in\nrespect of matters relating to the HK Listing (including in respect of\nthe principles in the HK Code) and its interaction with the ASX Listing\nRules on 12 June 2018 (English) and 14 June 2018 (Chinese).

The Company has adopted a\nformal Code of Conduct and other guidelines and policies which are\napproved by the Board that set out legal and ethical standards for the\nCompany’s Directors and employees, including a Conflicts of Interests\nand Related Party Transactions Policy.\nThe Code of Conduct and these other guidelines and policies guide\nthe Directors, the CEO, senior Executives, and employees generally as\nto the practices necessary to maintain confidence in the Company’s\nintegrity and as to the responsibility and accountability of individuals\nfor reporting, and investigating reports of, unethical practices.

The policy also protects individuals who\nin good faith report misconduct which they reasonably believe to be\ncorrupt, illegal or unethical on a confidential basis, without fear of\nreprisal, dismissal or discriminatory treatment; and assists in ensuring\nthat matters of misconduct and/or unethical behaviour are identified\nand dealt with appropriately.\nIndividuals can report their concerns confidentially online, via\nconfidential email to an external facilitator or by telephoning a\nconfidential Speak Up Line.\nAll disclosures made under this policy will be treated seriously and\nbe the subject of a thorough investigation with the objective of\nlocating evidence that either substantiates or refutes the misconduct\ndisclosed by an employee. Such investigations will be facilitated\nindependently from the business unit concerned, the employee who\nmade the disclosure or any person being the subject of the reportable\nconduct. The Company will determine, based on the seriousness of\nthe disclosure, whether the investigation will be conducted internally\nby a senior member of management or the external facilitator.\nPrinciple 4: Safeguard integrity in corporate reporting\nAudit and Risk Management Committee\nThe Board is responsible for preparing the financial statements and\naccounts of the Company.

Operational difficulties may impact the amount\nof coal produced, delay coal deliveries or increase the cost of mining\nfor a varying length of time. These operating risks include (but are not\nlimited to) industrial action, mine collapses, cave-ins or other failures\nrelating to mine infrastructure, including tailings dams, interruptions\ndue to inclement or hazardous weather conditions, power interruption,\ncritical equipment failure (in particular any protracted breakdown\nor issues with any of the Company’s CHPPs or a major excavator),\nfires, and explosions from methane gas or coal dust, accidental mine\nwater discharges, flooding and variations in or unusual or unexpected\ngeological or geotechnical mining conditions (particularly in the\nCompany’s underground operations). Such risks could result in\ndamage to applicable mines, personal injury, environmental damage,\ndelays in coal production, decreased coal production, loss of revenue,\nmonetary losses and possible legal liability. Although the Company’s\ninsurance policies provide coverage for some of these risks, the\namount and scope of insurance cover is limited by market and\neconomic factors and there can be no assurance that these risks\nwould be fully covered by insurances maintained by the Company.\nInjury or accident risks\nIf any injuries or accidents occur in a mine, this could have adverse\nfinancial implications including legal claims for personal injury, wrongful\ndeath, amendments to approvals, potential production delays or\nstoppages, any of which may have a material adverse effect on the\nfinancial performance and/or financial position of the Company.\nFunding risks\nThe amount of future funding required by the Company will depend\non a number of factors, including the performance of the Company’s\nbusiness at that time. The Company’s business operations and\ncash flow are highly sensitive to any fluctuation in the US$ coal price,\ncoal production from its operations, demand for its coal product and\nUS$ movement in foreign exchange rates, particularly movements in\nthe A$:US$ exchange rate.\nIn developing its business plan and operating budget, the Company\nhas made certain assumptions regarding coal prices, the A$:US$\nexchange rate, future production levels and other factors which\ndetermine the Company’s financial performance.\nIf a funding shortfall materialises, the Company may need to raise\nsubstantial additional debt or equity. The Company’s capacity to\nsecure the requisite level of funding will depend on the amount\nof funding required, the performance and future prospects of its\nbusiness and a number of other factors, including US$ coal prices,\ninterest rates, economic conditions, debt market conditions, equity\nmarket conditions and future levels of Yanzhou support.\nTo the extent that the Company is not able to secure additional\nfinancing (whether debt or equity) on acceptable terms from third\nparties, the Company will continue to rely on financial support\nfrom Yanzhou.\nAs at 31 December 2018, the Company had a loan receivable from\nWatagan of A$813 million (re-drawable up to A$1.36 billion) which\nis subject to impairment testing. There is a guarantee provided\nby Yankuang (being the ultimate parent entity of the Company) to\nindemnify the Company for any amounts due and payable under the\nloan which are not paid by Watagan.",

There can be no assurance that Yanzhou will be in a position\nto provide financial support to Yancoal or that Yankuang will be in a\nposition to meet its obligations under the guarantee in respect of the\nWatagan Agreements.\nAdverse foreign exchange rate movements\nForeign exchange risk is the risk of the Company sustaining loss\nthrough adverse movements in exchange rates. Such losses\ncan impact the Company’s financial position and performance\nand the level of additional funding required to support the\nCompany’s businesses.\nThe liabilities, earnings and cash flows of the Company are influenced\nby movements in exchange rates, especially movements in the\nA$:US$ exchange rate.\nWhile the Company operates entirely in Australia and its costs\nare primarily denominated in its functional currency, the A$,\nforeign currency exposure arises particularly in relation to coal\nsupply contracts, which generally are priced and payable in US$,\nprocurement of imported plant and equipment, which can be priced\nin US$ or other foreign currencies, and debt denominated in US$.\nThe impact of exchange rate movements will vary depending\non factors such as the nature, magnitude and duration of the\nmovements, the extent to which currency risk is hedged under\nforward exchange contracts or other hedging instruments and the\nterms of these contracts.\nThe hedging policy of the Company aims to protect against the\nvolatility of cash expenditures or reduced collection in the above\nmentioned transactions as well as to reduce the volatility of profit\nor loss for retranslation of US dollar denominated loans at each\nperiod end.\nHedging through bank-issued instruments\nOperating foreign exchange risk that arises from firm commitments\nor highly probable transactions is managed through the use of bank\nissued forward foreign currency contracts and collar option contracts.\nThe Company hedges a portion of contracted US dollar sales and\nasset purchases settled in foreign currencies in each currency to\nmitigate the adverse impact on cash flow due to the future rise or fall\nin Australian dollars against the relevant currencies.\nCoal prices and coal demand risk\nThe Company generates revenue from the sale of coal. In developing\nits business plan and operating budget, the Company makes certain\nassumptions regarding coal prices and demand for coal. The prices\nwhich the Company will receive for its coal depend on numerous\nmarket factors beyond its control and, accordingly, some underlying\ncoal price assumptions relied on by the Company may materially\nchange and actual coal prices and demand may differ materially from\nthose expected.\nThe prices for coal are determined predominantly by world markets,\nwhich are affected by numerous factors, including the outcome of\nfuture sale contract negotiations, general economic activity, industrial\nproduction levels, changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in\nenergy demand and demand for steel, changes in the supply of\nseaborne coal, technological changes, changes in production levels\nand events interfering with supply, changes in international freight\nrates or other transportation infrastructure and costs, the costs of\nother commodities and substitutes for coal, market changes in coal\nquality requirements, government regulations which restrict use of\ncoal, and tax impositions on the resources industry, all of which are\noutside the control of the Company and may have a material adverse\nimpact on coal prices and demand.\nIn addition, the coal price is highly dependent on the outlook for coal\nconsumption in large Asian economies, such as China, Japan and\nIndia, as well as any changes in government policy regarding coal\nor energy policy in those countries.\nAbsent offsetting factors, significant and sustained adverse\nmovements in demand for coal and, consequently, coal prices (both\ngenerally and in relation to particular types and classes of coal) may\nhave a material adverse impact on the ongoing financial performance\nand financial position of the Company or may result in the Company\nnot proceeding with the development of new mines and projects due\nto such development not being economically viable.\nAny weakening in coal prices or any deterioration prompted by further\nreduction in demand or addition of new tonnes to the seaborne\nmarket (for example from thermal coal exports from the US) would\nhave a material adverse impact on the financial performance of the\nCompany and its capacity to undertake development projects.\nCoal production risks\nImprovement in the Company’s financial performance is dependent\non the Company being able to sustain or increase coal production\nand decrease operating costs on a per tonne basis. The Company’s\nsuccess or failure in improving productivity will become particularly\nimportant to the Company’s financial performance if the coal price\nremains at current levels or falls further.\nThe Company’s coal production can be impacted by a number\nof factors, including unforeseen geological or geotechnical issues\n(particularly in the Company’s underground operations), changes or\nvariations in coal quality or geological, hydrologic or other conditions,\nadverse weather including abnormal wet weather conditions\n(particularly in Queensland), unforeseen delays or complexities\nin installing and operating mining longwall systems, protracted\nbreakdown of coal handling infrastructure and other mining equipment\nand rail and port breakdowns and outages. Regulatory factors and the\noccurrence of other operating risks can also limit production.\nDebt costs\nThe majority of the Company’s loans are US$ LIBOR based\nfloating rate loans and currently there are no interest rate hedging\narrangements in place. As a result, any increase in the US$ LIBOR\nfrom current levels will expose the Company to higher debt costs.",

The Company may be affected by changes in government\ntaxation and royalty policies or in the interpretation or application of\nsuch policies under Australian laws.\nThe potential of the Company to obtain the benefit of existing\ntax losses and claim other tax attributes will depend on future\ncircumstances and may be affected by changes in ownership of\nboth Yanzhou and Yancoal, business activities, thin capitalisation\nthresholds, tax bases and any other conditions relating to the use\nof tax losses or other attributes of the Group. The ability to use the\nCompany’s carried forward losses will depend on the Company’s\ncontinued satisfaction of the loss recoupment tests under Australian\ntax laws and be subject to the availability of sufficient future\ntaxable profits.\nAustralian Accounting Standards (AAS)\nAAS are issued by the AASB and are beyond the control of\nthe Company and the Directors. Any changes to AAS or to the\ninterpretation of those standards may have an adverse effect on the\nreported financial performance or financial position of the Company.\nIn particular, the accounting treatment for transactions such as\nthe transfer of the NSW mining assets of Ashton, Austar and\nDonaldson to Watagan could be reviewed by standard setters\nand may be subject to change. In the event that the Company is\nrequired to reconsolidate Watagan’s results and financial position\ninto its consolidated financial statements ahead of the scheduled\ndate in 2025, due to a change to AAS or their interpretation, the\nreconsolidation may have an adverse effect on the reported financial\nperformance or financial position of the Company.\nRegulatory approvals risks\nThe ability of the Company to meet its long-term production target\nprofile depends on (amongst other things) the Company being able\nto obtain on a timely basis, and maintain, all necessary regulatory\napprovals (including any approvals arising under applicable mining\nlaws, environmental regulations and other laws) for its current\noperations and expansion and growth projects, including obtaining\nplanning approvals, land access, land owner consents and addressing\nany native title issues, impacts on the environment and objections\nfrom local communities.\nThe requirement to obtain approvals and to address potential and\nactual issues for existing and future mining projects is common to\nall companies in the coal sector. However, there is no assurance\nor guarantee that the Company will be in a position to secure any\nor all of the required consents, approvals and rights necessary to\nmaintain its current production profile from its existing operations or to\ndevelop its growth projects in a manner which will result in profitable\nmining operations and the achievement of its long-term production\ntargets. If these approvals (or other approvals required for the planned\nproduction increases) are not obtained, or if conditional or limited\napprovals are obtained, the economic viability of the relevant projects\nmay be adversely affected, which may in turn result in the value of the\nrelevant assets being impaired.\nThe Company continues to engage openly and transparently with all\nState and Federal Government and approval bodies, while operating\nto the highest safety, environmental and legislative standards to work\ntowards facilitating all approvals in a timely manner.\nEstimates of Resources and Reserves and geology\nThe volume and quality of the coal that the Company recovers may\nbe less than the Resource and Reserve estimates reported to date.\nResource and Reserve estimates are expressions of judgement based\non knowledge, experience and industry practice. There are risks\nassociated with such estimates, including that coal mined may be of\na different quality or grade, tonnage or strip ratio from those in the\nestimates and the ability to economically extract and process the coal\nmay not eventuate. Resource and Reserve estimates are necessarily\nimprecise and depend to some extent on interpretations and\ngeological assumptions, coal prices, cost assumptions, and statistical\ninferences which may ultimately prove to have been unreliable.\nCoal Resource and Coal Reserve estimates are regularly revised\nbased on actual production experience or new information and could\ntherefore be expected to change. Furthermore, should the Company\nencounter mineralisation or formations different from those predicted\nby past drilling, sampling and similar examinations, Coal Resource\nand Coal Reserve estimates may have to be adjusted and mining\nplans, coal processing and infrastructure may have to be altered in\na way that might adversely affect their operations. If it is determined\nthat mining of certain Coal Reserves is uneconomic, this may lead to\na reduction in the Company’s aggregate Coal Reserve estimates.\nMaterial changes in Coal Reserve estimates, grades, strip ratios,\nwashing yields or recovery rates may affect the economic viability\nof projects. Coal Reserve estimates should not be interpreted\nas assurances of mine life or of the profitability of current or\nfuture operations.\nIf the Company’s actual Coal Resource and Coal Reserve estimates\nare less than current estimates, the Company’s prospects, value,\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition may be\nmaterially adversely affected.\nTake or pay liabilities\nPort and rail (above rail and below rail) capacity is generally contracted\nvia long-term take-or-pay contracts. The Company will generally be\nrequired to pay for its contracted rail or port tonnage irrespective of\nwhether it is utilised. Unused port or rail capacity can arise as a result\nof circumstances including insufficient production from a given mine,\na mismatch between port and rail capacity for a mine, or an inability\nto transfer the used capacity due to contractual limitations such as\nrequired consent of the provider of the port or rail services, or because\nthe coal must emanate from specified source mines or be loaded onto\ntrains at specified load points.\nUncertainty in costs forecast\nThe business operations and financial condition of the Company\nmay vary with fluctuations in production and capital costs. Changes\nin the costs of mining and processing operations as well as capital\ncosts could occur, including as a result of unforeseen events, such\nas international and local economic and political events (including\nmovement in exchange rates) or unexpected geological or mining\nconditions, and could have material adverse financial consequences\nfor the Company.\nNICG and WICET debt\nAs a shipper in NCIG and WICET, the Company’s source mines are\nrequired to maintain a minimum level of Marketable Coal Reserves\n(11 years’ worth of contracted capacity). Non-compliance with this\nrequirement would result in the termination of the individual contracts\nand require the Company to pay its share of any outstanding senior\ndebt, amortised over the remaining 10 years of that particular\ncontract. The Company’s current share of the outstanding senior\ndebt is approximately A$1 billion and A$0.3 billion, respectively.",

In addition, there is a risk that claims may be\nmade arising from environmental remediation upon closure of one or\nmore of the sites.\nCoal supply agreements\nThe Company’s coal supply agreements typically require the delivery\nof a fixed or minimum quantity of coal at a location, at a time and\nover a period stipulated in the agreement. To the extent that any\ncontracted volumes cannot be delivered as agreed, the Company\nmay be liable to pay substantial compensation for the resulting losses,\ncosts and charges (including demurrage) incurred by the buyer.\nAs customer contracts expire, the Company will be likely to renew\ncontracts with long-term customers, or seek to enter into new\ncontracts with new buyers and markets, depending on the feasibility\nof this. Tonnes that are not contracted are sold into the spot market\nat either index-linked or fixed price levels. The Company’s strategy\nfor 2019 will be to increase its term contracted position as well as\nto target end-user customers as opposed to traders.\nMost of the Company’s coal supply agreements also require\nthe delivery of coal meeting specified quality thresholds for\ncharacteristics such as moisture content, sulphur content and ash\ncontent. Depending on these quality thresholds, coal will be sold into\nmarkets that are the highest paying for coal with the relevant qualities.\nThe Company derives a significant portion of its revenue from a limited\nnumber of customers, and the loss of, or a reduction in, sales to any\nof these customers could materially and adversely affect its business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nJoint ventures and reliance on third parties\nThe Company holds a number of joint venture interests, including\ninterests in the Middlemount, Moolarben, HVO, Mount Thorley and\nWarkworth joint ventures, PWCS, NCIG and WICET, with other parties.\nDecision making, management, marketing and other key aspects of\neach joint venture are regulated by agreements between the relevant\njoint venture participants. Under these agreements, certain decisions\nrequire the endorsement of third party joint venture participants and\nthe Company relies on the co-operation of these third parties for the\nsuccess of its current operations and/or the development of its growth\nprojects and the transportation of increased production.\nThe Company cannot control the actions of third party joint venture\nparticipants, and therefore cannot guarantee that joint ventures will\nbe operated or managed in accordance with the preferred direction\nor strategy of the Company. There is a risk that the veto rights of,\nor consents required from, the joint venture partners will prevent the\nbusiness and assets of a joint venture from being developed, operated\nand managed in accordance with that preferred direction or strategy.\nThe Company also uses contractors and other third parties for\nexploration, mining and other services generally, and is reliant on\na number of third parties for the success of its current operations\nand for the development of its growth projects. While this is normal\nfor the mining and exploration industry, problems caused by third\nparties may arise which may have an impact on the performance and\noperations of the Company. Any failure by counterparties to perform\ntheir obligations may have a material adverse effect on the Company\nand there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful\nin attempting to enforce its contractual rights through legal action.\nCompetition\nThe Company faces competition in all aspects of its business,\nincluding sales and marketing, pricing of coal, production capacity,\ncoal quality and specifications, transportation capacity, cost structure\nand brand recognition. The Company’s coal business competes in\nthe domestic and international markets with other large domestic and\ninternational coal producers. An increase in production or reduction\nin prices of competing coal from both Australia and overseas may\nadversely impact the Company’s ability to sell its coal products and\nthe price to be attained for sales. Increased competition in the future,\nincluding from new competitors, may emerge. This competition may\nrelate not only to coal produced and sold, but also to competition for\nthe acquisition of new projects, which may adversely affect the ability\nof the Company to acquire new interests on acceptable terms should\nit wish to make such acquisitions.\nFurther industry consolidation could result in competitors improving\ntheir scale or productivity or competitors may develop lower-cost\ngeological coal resources or develop resources in lower cost base\ngeographies, increasing pressure on the Company’s ability to maintain\nits margins.\nThere is significant competition within the resources industry in\nAustralia, the United States and Asia. Furthermore, new entrants\nto the industry may emerge in one or more of those markets,\nincreasing the competitive pressure on the Company. This pressure\ncould adversely affect the Company’s market share and financial\nperformance and position.\nThe Company supplies coal as fuel to, among others, the thermal\npower generation industry and, as a result, is affected by the demand\nand growth of the thermal power industry. Thermal coal as a fuel\nsource competes, among others, with natural gas, and the price of\nnatural gas can therefore affect coal sales. The natural gas market\nhas been volatile historically and prices in this market are subject to\nwide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply\nand demand. The thermal power generation industry is also affected\nby the development of alternative energy sources, climate change\nand global environmental factors.",

      "text_content": "CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT    ANNUAL REPORT 2018      95\nTitle risks\nExploring or mining for coal is generally illegal without a tenement\ngranted by the State Governments. The grant and renewal of\ntenements is subject to a regulatory regime and each tenement\nis subject to certain conditions. There is no certainty that an\napplication for grant or renewal of a tenement will be granted at all\nor on satisfactory terms or within expected timeframes. Further, the\nconditions attached to tenements may change. The permitting rules\nare complex and may change over time, making the title holder’s\nresponsibility to comply with the applicable requirements more\nonerous, more costly or even impossible, thereby precluding or\nimpairing continuing or future mining operations. There is a risk that\nthe Company may lose title to any of its granted titles if it is unable\nto comply with conditions or if the land subject to the title is required\nfor public purposes. There is also a risk that a tenement may not\nbe granted from any applications for renewals of tenements or for\nnew tenements.\nObtaining mining tenements often involves first obtaining consents\nfrom landholders and other third parties, some of which may in\ncertain circumstances have a right of veto, as well as approvals\n(such as environmental approvals). There is a risk that the requisite\nconsents and approvals may not be able to be obtained on time\nor on acceptable commercial terms, or may not be able to be\nobtained at all, and consequently have an adverse financial effect\non the Company.\nNative Title\nIt is possible that, in relation to tenements which we have an interest in\nor will in the future acquire, there may be areas over which legitimate\nnative title rights of Aboriginal Australians may exist. Where the grant\nor renewal of a tenement is in respect of land in relation to which\nnative title may exist, the Company will need to comply with the Native\nTitle Act 1993 (Cth) in order for the tenement to be validly granted.\nCompliance with the NTA (and the relevant native title process to\nbe followed for the grant of the tenement e.g. the right to negotiate\nprocess) may be prolonged or delayed, and substantial compensation\nmay be payable as part of any agreement reached, including for\nthe extinguishment or impairment of the relevant native title rights\nand interests.\nThe existence or determination of native title may, therefore, affect the\nexisting or future activities of the Company and impact on its ability\nto develop projects which may in turn impact its operational and\nfinancial performance.\nUnder the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983 (NSW), Aboriginal Land\nCouncils can claim crown land if certain requirements are met. If a\nclaim is successful, freehold title over the relevant land is transferred\nto the claimant council. Further, Aboriginal Land Councils are\nafforded certain statutory rights which can include a requirement to\nenter into a compensation agreement prior to the grant of a Mining\nLease. This may delay the grant of future mining tenements over\nany area of such land. Some of our tenements are located in areas\nthat are subject to outstanding Aboriginal land claims, and additional\nAboriginal land claims may be made in the future over other areas\nin which our tenements are located. Any such claims may result in\nour ability to explore or mine for coal in these areas being subject to\nthe decisions of the relevant Aboriginal Land Councils, which may\nadversely affect our ability to develop projects and, consequently,\nour operational and financial performance.\nOverlapping tenement risks\nSome of the Company’s mines and associated tenements adjoin or\nare overlapped by petroleum tenements and adjoin other exploration\ninterests held by third parties. Overlapping tenements could potentially\nprevent, delay or increase the cost of the future development of\nthe Company’s projects because the Company and the relevant\npetroleum exploration licence or other exploration licence holders\ncould potentially seek to undertake their respective activities on the\noverlapping area or the same resource seams and in some cases\nthe overlapping petroleum tenure holder’s consent may be required.\nThere is no guarantee that agreement will be reached with the\noverlapping petroleum tenement holder or that agreement will not\nbe delayed or will be reached on terms satisfactory to the Company.\nThere is also a risk that if agreement cannot be reached with\noverlapping tenement holders the matter may be referred to the\nrelevant minister or a court who may make a decision which adversely\nimpacts upon or prevents the project proposed by the Company.\nEnforcement and counterparty insolvency risks\nThe Company has entered into contracts which are important to the\nfuture of its businesses including (but not limited to) for the provision\nof coal handling services, long-term sales contracts, debt facilities,\nlong-term leases, contract mining and the provision of certain\nguarantees, indemnities and sureties.\nAny failure by counterparties to perform those contracts may\nhave a material adverse effect on the Company and there can be\nno assurance that it would be successful in enforcing any of its\ncontractual rights through legal action.\nIn addition, any insolvency of a counterparty to any of these contracts\nmay have a material adverse effect on the Company and there can\nbe no assurance that it would be successful in enforcing any of its\ncontractual rights through legal action or recovering all monies owed\nby that counterparty (including under any claim for damages).\nCoal royalties\nRoyalties are payable to the NSW and QLD State Governments\non coal produced in NSW and QLD. In both States, the royalties\nare payable on an ad valorem basis as they are calculated as a\npercentage of the value for which the coal is sold. The relevant\nState Governments may increase these royalties or their method of\ncalculation. Any impost of new royalty related State tax or increase in\nroyalty rates may have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial\nposition and/or financial performance.\nClimate change/carbon regulation risks\nThe regulatory response to the risk of climate change, including\nunilateral and collective action by Australia and other countries,\nmay affect demand for coal, coal prices and the competitiveness\nof the Company’s products in the world energy market.\nIn November 2014, an agreement was announced between the\nUnited States and China to cut greenhouse gas emissions by more\nthan 25% below 2005 levels by 2025. This agreement was followed\nby the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, and the\nsigning of the Paris Agreement within the United Nationals Framework\nConvention on Climate Change. The Paris Agreement was signed\nby representatives from 195 countries, and aims to hold back the\nincrease in global temperatures, increase the ability of countries to\nadapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and provide channels\nto finance projects that lead to greenhouse gas reductions.",

      "text_content": "CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (CONTINUED)\n96      YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\nIn recent years, China has also taken steps to address severe air\npollution in many Chinese cities by adopting a range of policies to\nlower carbon emissions and reduce coal usage.\nExtensive government regulations relating to climate change impose\ncosts on the mining operations of the Company, and future regulations\ncould increase those costs, limit the Company’s ability to produce\nand sell coal, or reduce demand for the Company’s coal products.\nTechnological change\nThermal coal as a source of energy competes with other forms of\nelectricity generation (such as hydro, solar and wind). In recent years,\nthe global shift from conventional fuels to renewable sources of energy\nhas created greater competition for thermal coal in the market.\nAs renewable technologies become more efficient and cost effective,\nthey may gain an economic advantage over coal-fired and other\nfossil fuel based electricity generation. These economic factors,\ncombined with increasing costs to comply with emission limits for\nother air pollutants, may result in the continued retirement of existing\ncoal-powered generation capacity, and the cancellation of planned\nadditional coal-fired power capacity, which may reduce demand for\nthermal coal in the market.\nTechnology\nThe Company’s business relies on the performance, reliability and\navailability of its information technology systems. Information and\noperating technology may be subject to international cyber security\nthreats. Breaches could result in (but are not limited to) the loss of\nsensitive information, unplanned outage of business-critical systems,\nenvironmental damage and misappropriation of Company funds. The\nCompany’s information technology infrastructure in general may also\nbe adversely affected by factors such as server damage, equipment\nfaults, power failure, computer viruses, misuse by employees\nor contractors, telecommunications failures, external malicious\nintervention such as hacking, terrorism, fire, natural disasters, or\nweather interventions. Such events are largely beyond the Company’s\ncontrol, and may affect its ability to carry on its operations efficiently.\nKey personnel\nA number of key personnel are important to attaining the business\ngoals of the Company. One or more of these key employees could\nleave their employment or cease to actively participate in the\nmanagement of the Company and this may adversely affect the ability\nof the Company to conduct its business and, accordingly, affect its\nfinancial performance and its share price. There may be a limited\nnumber of persons with the requisite experience and skills to serve in\nthe Company’s senior management positions if existing management\nleave the Company. If the Company cannot attract, train and retain\nqualified managers, and other personnel, the Company may be\nunable to successfully manage its growth or otherwise compete\neffectively in the Australian coal industry.\nThe Company is also dependent on attracting qualified technical\nemployees to provide services in relation to certain of its coal and\nother mining operations. Coal mining is a labour-intensive industry.\nThe Company’s future success will depend greatly on its and its\nmining contractors’ continued ability to attract and retain skilled\nand qualified personnel on economic terms.\nFraud or misconduct\nAny fraud, misrepresentation, money laundering or other misconduct\nby the Company’s employees, customers, service providers, business\npartners or other third parties could result in violations of relevant\nlaws and regulations by the Company and subject the Company to\ncorresponding regulatory sanctions. These unlawful activities and\nother misconduct may have occurred in the past and may occur in the\nfuture, and may result in civil and criminal liability under increasingly\nstringent laws or cause serious reputational or financial harm to the\nCompany. While the Company has in place and is implementing\nmeasures aimed at detecting and preventing employees’ and external\nparties’ fraud, misrepresentation, money laundering, commercial\nbribery and other misconduct, the Company may not be able to timely\ndetect or prevent such activities, which could subject the Company\nto regulatory investigations and criminal and civil liability, harm its\nreputation and have a material adverse effect on the Company’s\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nEnvironmental activism\nEnvironmental lobby groups in both QLD and NSW have recently\nmade submissions opposing both operation and expansion of coal\nmines in an attempt to prevent new mine developments or expansion\nof existing mines on the basis of environmental concerns. Increased\ncommunity concern and adverse actions taken by community and\nenvironmental groups may delay or prevent the Company from\nprogressing new mine developments or development or expansion\nof existing mines, or may mean that those mines are subject to\nconditions that adversely affect their profitability and consequently\nthe financial performance of the Company.\nChanges in government policy, regulation or legislation\nThe resources industry is subject to extensive legislation,\nregulations and supervision by a number of Federal and State\nregulatory organisations.\nAny future legislation and regulatory change may affect the\nresources industry and may adversely affect the Company’s financial\nperformance and position, such as future laws that may limit the\nemission of greenhouse gases or the use of coal in power generation.\nEnvironment and planning\nIn recent years, State Government policies of NSW and QLD have\nbeen introduced in the interests of protecting agricultural and urban\nland from the effects of mining. These include the QLD Government’s\nCentral Queensland Plan and Regional Planning Interests Act and\nthe NSW Government’s Strategic Regional Land Use Policy, Aquifer\nInterference Policy, and 2013 amendments to the State Environmental\nPlanning Policy (Mining, Petroleum Production and Extractive\nIndustries) 2007. Each of these policies is relevant to the areas in\nwhich the Company has mining operations. Accordingly, there is no\nassurance that the future development and exploration activities of\nthe Company will result in profitable or commercially viable mining\noperations in these areas.\nIn 2013, the NSW State Government introduced the fit and proper\nperson consideration in making decisions about mining rights\nincluding the grant, transfer, renewal, cancellation and suspension\nof such rights. This allows the Government to consider a miner’s\nconduct (in particular its compliance with environmental and mining\nlegislation), as well as a miner’s financial capabilities and technical\nexpertise. In recent years, the NSW State Government has also\nsignificantly increased the maximum penalties for breaches of mining\nand environmental legislation, and the resources of regulators to\ninvestigate possible breaches and prosecute mining companies.\nThese changes have resulted in the updating of compliance\nprograms, and increased the risk of prosecution for breaches\nof relevant legislation.\nIn 2013, the QLD State Government reviewed the method of\ncalculating the financial assurance required to be provided by mining\ncompanies in respect of their rehabilitation liability and this review\nlead to a significant increase in financial assurance amounts that are\nrequired to be covered by bank guarantees. The Audit Office of NSW\nhas carried out a review of rehabilitation liabilities in respect of mines\nand the review has led to an increase in the amount of security\nrequired in respect of rehabilitation liabilities.",

The Company could become exposed to claims or\nlitigation by persons alleging they are owed fees or other contractual\nentitlements, employees, regulators, competitors or other third\nparties. Such claims or proceedings could divert our management’s\ntime and attention and consume financial resources in their defence\nor prosecution.\nInsurance\nThe Company has insurance coverage for certain operating risks.\nHowever, it may become subject to liability (including in relation to\npollution, occupational illnesses or other hazards), or suffer loss\nresulting from business interruption, for which it is not insured\n(or has not sufficiently insured) or cannot insure, including liabilities\nin respect of past activities.\nShould a major uninsured loss be suffered, future financial\nperformance could be materially adversely affected. In addition,\ninsurance may not continue to be available at economically\nacceptable premiums. As a result, the insurance coverage may\nnot cover the full scope and extent of claims against the Company\nor losses it may incur, including, but not limited to, claims for\nenvironmental or industrial accidents, occupational illnesses, pollution\nand product liability, war, terrorism and business interruption.\nTo the extent a successful claim against the Company proceeds,\nit may have a material adverse effect on its financial position.\nExploration and development risks\nThe Company’s existing coal reserves will decline as mining continues.\nTherefore, the Company’s growth and long-term success will depend\non its ability to acquire additional coal resources within its exploration\nareas and to convert such coal resources into economically\nrecoverable coal reserves.\nThere are several risks relating to coal mining exploration and\ndevelopment which are common to the industry and which, if realised,\nhave the capacity to affect the operations, production, cash flow and\nfinancial performance of the Company.\nDevelopment and exploration activities may be affected by factors\nbeyond the control of the Company, including geological conditions,\nseismic activity, mineralisation, consistency and predictability of coal\ngrades, changes to law, changes to the regulatory framework applying\nto mining, overlapping resources tenure, and the rights of indigenous\npeople on whose land exploration activities are undertaken.\nAny discovery of a coal deposit does not guarantee that the mining of\nthat deposit would be commercially viable, with the size of the deposit,\ndevelopment and operating costs, land ownership, coal prices and\nrecovery rates all being key factors in determining commercial viability.\nIssues that arise during development, construction and mine start-\nup may result in increased costs, delayed commencement of coal\nproduction, delayed receipt of coal revenue or coal production not\ncommencing at all. These problems may include delays in obtaining\napprovals (including land use approvals) or in the construction of mine\ninfrastructure. There are many milestones which need to be met in a\ntimely fashion for production to commence on any projects currently\nin the pre-development or development stages.\nThe Company may also be exposed to risks including risks of default\nassociated with managing contractual relationships with participants\nin any of the development or exploration joint ventures or other\ncontractual relationships to which it is, or may become, a party.\nTransport and infrastructure\nCoal produced from the Company’s mining operations is transported\nto customers by a combination of road, rail and sea. Fluctuations in\ntransportation costs and disruptions to our railway and port linkages\ncould disrupt the Company’s coal deliveries and adversely affect its\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nA number of factors could disrupt or restrict access to essential coal\ntransportation and handling services, including (but not limited to):\n––\nweather related problems;\n––\nkey equipment and infrastructure failures;\n––\nrail or port capacity constraints;\n––\ncongestions and inter-system losses;\n––\nindustrial action;\n––\nfailure to obtain consents from third parties for access to rail\nor land;\n––\nfailure or delay in the construction of new rail or port capacity;\n––\nfailure to meet contractual requirements;\n––\naccess is removed or not granted by regulatory authority;\n––\nterrorist attacks or other similar events;\n––\nbreach of regulatory framework;\n––\nmismatch of below rail capacity, above rail capacity and port\ncapacity; and\n––\npossible sale of infrastructure,\nall or any of which could impair the Company’s ability to supply coal\nto customers and/or increase costs, and consequently may have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company’s financial position.\nSignificant increases in transport costs (such as emissions control\nrequirements and fluctuations in the price of diesel fuel and\ndemurrage) could make the Company’s coal less competitive when\ncompared to other fuels or coal produced from other regions.\nEnvironmental risks\nDue to the nature of coal mining processes, and the associated\nby-products, residues and tailings generated from these processes,\nall operations of the Company are subject to stringent environmental\nlaws and regulations.\nThere is a risk that past, present or future operations have not met\nor will not meet environmental or related regulatory requirements\nand/or that the approvals or modifications the Company is currently\nseeking, or may need to seek in the future, will not be granted. If\nthe Company is unsuccessful in these efforts or otherwise breaches\nthese environmental requirements, it may incur fines or penalties, be\nrequired to curtail or cease operations and/or be subject to increased\ncompliance costs or costs for rehabilitation or rectification works,\nwhich have not been previously planned at one or more of its sites.\nExtensive environmental regulations in Australia, and in other countries\nthat could affect the Company’s business, may impose costs on its\nmining operations, and future regulations could increase those costs,\nlimit its ability to produce and sell coal, or reduce demand for the\nCompany’s our coal products. In particular, the regulatory response to\nthe risk of climate change, including unilateral and collective action by\nAustralia and other countries, may affect demand for coal, coal prices\nand the competitiveness of the Company’s products in the world\nenergy market in the medium to long term.",

      "text_content": "CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (CONTINUED)\n98      YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\nChanges in and future environmental regulations could increase\nthe standards and costs of compliance, and adversely affect the\nCompany’s ability to generate the expected economic returns from\nits mining assets over their useful lives. The Company may not\nalways be able to comply with future laws and regulations in relation\nto environmental protection economically or at all. There can be no\nassurance that the Company will be able to fully and economically\nutilise the entire coal resources of the mines it operates currently or in\nthe future or that some of its mining assets will not become “stranded\nassets” that are not able to generate the expected economic returns\nover their useful lives.\nEnvironmental legislation may change in a manner that may require\ncompliance with additional standards, and a heightened degree of\nresponsibility for companies and their directors and employees. There\nmay also be unforeseen environmental liabilities resulting from coal\nrelated activities, which may be costly to remedy. In particular, the\nacceptable level of pollution and the potential abandonment costs\nand obligations for which the Company may become liable as a\nresult of its activities may be impossible to assess under the current\nlegal framework.\nHealth, safety and hazardous materials risks\nThe Company‘s operations may substantially impact the environment\nor cause exposure to hazardous materials. It will use hazardous\nmaterials and will generate hazardous waste, and may be subject to\ncommon law claims, damages due to natural disasters, and other\ndamages, as well as the investigation and clean-up of soil, surface\nwater, groundwater, and other media. Such claims may arise, for\nexample, out of current or former activities at sites that it owns\nor operates.\nThere is also a risk that actions could be brought against the\nCompany, alleging adverse effects of such substances on personal\nhealth. If any injuries or accidents occur in a mine, this could have\nadverse financial implications including legal claims for personal injury,\nwrongful death, amendments to approvals, potential production\ndelays or stoppages, any of which may have a material adverse effect\non the financial performance and/or financial position of the Company.\nThere is a risk that past, present or future operations have not met,\nor will not meet, health and safety requirements and/or that the\napprovals or modifications the Company is currently seeking, or\nmay need to seek in the future, will not be granted at all or on terms\nthat are unduly onerous. If the Company is unsuccessful in these\nefforts or otherwise breaches these health and safety requirements,\nit may incur fines or penalties, be required to curtail or cease\noperations and/or be subject to increased compliance costs or\ncosts for rehabilitation or rectification works, which have not been\npreviously planned, at one or more of its sites.\nImpairment risks\nThe Company’s balance sheet includes a number of assets that are\nsubject to impairment risk, including mining tenements, exploration\nand evaluation assets, goodwill, the Middlemount loan and royalty\nreceivable, the Watagan loan receivable and investments accounted\nfor using the equity method.\nThe value of these assets is derived from the fundamental valuation\nof the underlying mining operations and as such is subject to many of\nthe risks including, but not limited to, coal price and demand, foreign\nexchange, coal production, estimates of reserves and resources,\nuncertainty in costs forecasts, operating risks, injury and mine closure.\nAdverse changes in these risk factors could lead to a reduction in the\nvaluation of the Company’s assets and result in an impairment charge\nbeing recognised.\nInternal audit function\nThe internal audit function is managed by the GM of Risk and\nAssurance. That person has direct access to the Chair of the Audit\nand Risk Management Committee, as well as to the CEC, to whom\nhe directly reports. The CEC and the Audit and Risk Management\nCommittee recommend to the Board the appointment of the GM\nof Risk and Assurance.\nThe GM of Risk and Assurance has unfettered access to the Audit\nand Risk Management Committee and its Chair to seek information\nand explanations. The Chair of the Audit and Risk Management\nCommittee meets independently with the GM Risk and Assurance.\nThe role of the GM Risk and Assurance includes achievement\nof the internal audit objectives, risk management policies and\ninsurance strategy.\nAn annual program for internal audit and risk assurance is provided\nto the Audit and Risk Management Committee for approval. The\nannual Internal Audit program is focused on key operating risks and\nprocesses, control design and operating effectiveness.\nThe program includes a review of compliance with the obligations\nimposed by the General Rules on Internal Control for Enterprises and\nthe Supporting Guidelines of Internal Control for Enterprises, jointly\nissued by five Chinese ministries.\nPeriodical status reports on the execution of the plan, including\ncurrent findings and actions, are provided to the Audit and Risk\nManagement Committee. This includes key issues and subsequently\ncorrective actions are monitored, reviewed and reported. Any material\nfindings are reported to the Board.\nHealth, Safety and Environment Compliance\nThe Company has adopted policies to comply with occupational\nhealth, safety, environment and other laws. The Board has a Health,\nSafety and Environment Policy in place since May 2016 which applies\nacross the Company. In addition, each mine site has its own health,\nsafety and environmental policies and procedures to deal with their\nparticular health, safety and environmental issues. The Board has\nestablished a Health, Safety and Environment Committee to assist\nit in overseeing the Company’s health, safety and environmental\nresponsibilities. In accordance with its charter, which was reviewed\nand amended in October 2018 to provide for relevant provisions\nof the HK Listing Rules, this committee has a minimum of at least\nthree members. The current members of this committee are David\nMoult (appointed 6 February 2018) (Chair of the committee), Geoffrey\nRaby, Fuqi Wang and Fucun Wang (appointed 8 June 2018). Vincent\nO’Rourke resigned as Chair of the committee on 30 January 2018.\nIt is intended the committee meets at least four times per year, or as\nfrequently as required. The committee meetings are held at one of the\nCompany’s mine sites, whenever possible, to receive feedback from\nthe health, safety and environment forum held at the mine site and to\naddress any mine-specific health, safety and environment issues.",

      "text_content": "CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT    ANNUAL REPORT 2018      99\nPrinciple 8: Remunerate fairly and responsibly\nNomination and Remuneration Committee\nThe Board has established a Nomination and Remuneration\nCommittee. In accordance with its charter, which was reviewed and\namended in October 2018 to provide for relevant provisions of the\nHK Listing Rules, this committee currently has five members, Helen\nGillies (appointed 8 June 2018) (Chair of the committee, member since\n6 February 2018), Xiangqian Wu and Gregory Fletcher (appointed\n8 June 2018), Baocai Zhang (appointed 8 June 2018) and David Moult\n(appointed 8 June 2018). Xiyong Li resigned as the Chair on 8 June\n2018 and Cunliang Lai resigned as a member of the committee on\n8 June 2018. Three of the members of the committee, including the\nChair of the committee, are independent Directors of the Company,\nin line with the ASX Recommendations. The Nomination and\nRemuneration Committee Charter can be found within the Corporate\nGovernance section of the Company’s website.\nThe committee makes recommendations to the Board to achieve\nCompany remuneration structures that are equitable and aligned with\nthe long-term interests of the Company and its shareholders, to attract\nand retain skilled employees, to structure short- and long-term\nincentives that are challenging and linked to creation of sustainable\nreturns and to ensure any termination benefits are justifiable\nand appropriate.\nIn 2018, the committee engaged consulting firm Aon Hewitt (Aon)\nto provide independent market benchmarking with respect to the\nremuneration of Yancoal Executives and Non-Executive Directors.\nAon presented its recommendations to the committee in Q1 and Q2\n2018, which were endorsed by the committee for Board approval.\nThe Board adopted the recommendations in May 2018.\nThe committee has the necessary power and resources to meet\nits responsibilities under its charter, including rights of access to\nmanagement, auditors and external advisors. It is intended that\nthe committee will meet at least once per year, or as frequently\nas required.\nRemuneration of Non-Executive Directors\nThe Constitution provides that the Non-Executive Directors are entitled\nto such remuneration as approved by the Company’s shareholders\nin accordance with the Constitution, which must not exceed the\naggregate annual amount as determined by the Company in general\nmeeting or by its major shareholder, Yanzhou.\nRemuneration for Non-Executive Directors is capped at an aggregate\namount for each financial year of $3.5 million. Non-Executive\nDirectors may also be paid such additional or special remuneration\nas the Directors decide is appropriate where a Non-Executive\nDirector performs extra services or makes special exertions for\nthe benefit of the Company. Such additional remuneration will not\nform part of the calculation of the aggregate cap on Non-Executive\nDirectors’ remuneration for a financial year and does not require\nshareholder approval. No Director is involved in determining his\nor her own remuneration.\nFurther details of the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors,\nExecutive Directors and senior Executives can be found in the\nRemuneration Report on pages 64 to 77.\nDealings in Company securities\nBy law, and under the Company’s Insider Trading Policy, dealing in\nCompany securities is subject to the overriding prohibition on trading\nwhile in possession of inside information.\nIn addition, the Company’s Share Trading Policy prohibits dealing\nin Company securities or Yanzhou securities by Directors, senior\nExecutives and other relevant employees, as well as their closely\nrelated parties, during specified blackout periods each year. General\nemployees are permitted to deal in Company securities outside these\nblackout periods; however additional approval requirements apply to\nDirectors, the CEO and the CFO. The Share Trading Policy precludes\nrelevant employees from entering into any hedge or derivative\ntransactions relating to unvested options or share rights granted to\nthem under incentive plans and securities that are subject to holding\nlocks or restrictions on dealing under such plans. There are also\nrestrictions that apply to relevant employees from entering into margin\nlending arrangements and short-term trading of the Company’s\nsecurities. Breaches of the policy are treated seriously and may lead to\ndisciplinary action, including dismissal.\nThe Board approved revisions to its share trading policy in October\n2018 with the requirements set out in the Model Code for Securities\nTransactions by Directors of Listed Issuers (the Model Code) as set\nout in Appendix 10 of the HK Listing Rules to regulate the Directors’\nsecurities transactions, which is also applicable to the Company’s\nemployees who are likely to be in possession of unpublished\ninside information.\nSpecific enquiry has been made of all the Directors and they have\neach confirmed that they have complied with the Company’s Share\nTrading Policy and Insider Trading Policy (which is more stringent than\nthe Model Code) since the HK Listing (on 6 December 2018) to 31\nDecember 2018.\nCopies of the Company’s Share Trading Policy and Insider Trading\nPolicy are available on the Corporate Governance section of the\nCompany’s website.\nThis Corporate Governance Statement has been approved by the\nBoard and is current as at 25 February 2019.",

Yancoal Australia Ltd is a for-profit\nentity for the purpose of preparing the financial statements.\nThe financial statements were authorised for issue in accordance\nwith a resolution of the Directors on 25 February 2019.\n(i) Compliance with IFRS\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group also comply\nwith International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued\nby the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”).\n(ii) Subsidiaries\nThe Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has\nrights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has\nthe ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.\nSubsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control\nis transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date\nthat control ceases.\nThe acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business\ncombinations by the Group. Intercompany transactions, balances\nand unrealised gains on transactions between the Group companies\nare eliminated.\nUnrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides\nevidence of the impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting\npolicies of subsidiaries are aligned to ensure consistency with the\npolicies adopted by the Group.\n(iii) Significant accounting policies\nSignificant accounting policies have been included in the\nrelevant notes to which the policies relate, and other significant\naccounting policies are discussed in Note F6. These policies\nhave been consistently applied to all the years presented,\nunless otherwise stated.\n(iv) Historical cost convention\nThese financial statements have been prepared on an accrual\nbasis and under the historical cost convention, as modified by the\nrevaluation of available for sale financial assets and financial assets\nand liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through\nprofit or loss.\n(v) Auditor sign-off – unqualified and unmodified\nThe independent auditor’s report of these consolidated financial\nstatements is unqualified and unmodified. Refer to page 172 for\nfurther details.\n(vi) Rounding of amounts\nThe Company is of a kind referred to in ASIC Legislative Instrument\n2016/191, issued by the Australian Securities and Investments\nCommission, relating to the “rounding off” of amounts in the financial\nstatements. Amounts in the financial statements have been rounded\noff in accordance with that legislative instrument to the nearest million\ndollars, or in certain cases, the nearest dollar.\n(vii) New and amended standards adopted by the Group\nEffective from 1 January 2018 the Group adopted new standards\nincluding AASB 9 Financial Instruments and AASB 15 Revenue from\nContracts with Customers. Refer to Note F7 for details.\n(viii) Impact of standards issued but not yet applied by the Group\nAustralian Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued but not\nyet applicable for the year ended 31 December 2018 that have not\nbeen applied by the Group are disclosed in Note F8.\n(ix) Early adoption of standards\nCertain new accounting standards and interpretations have been\npublished that are not mandatory for 31 December 2018 reporting\nperiods and have not been early adopted by the Group. The Group’s\nassessment of the impact of these new standards and interpretations\nis set out in Note F8.\n(x) Critical accounting estimates and judgements\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the use of certain\ncritical accounting estimates and judgements that involve a higher\ndegree of judgement or complexity. It also requires management\nto exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s\naccounting policies.\nThe Directors evaluate estimates and judgements incorporated\ninto these financial statements based on historical knowledge and\nbest available current information. Estimates assume a reasonable\nexpectation of future events and are based on current trends and\neconomic data, obtained both externally and within the Company.\nThe resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal\nthe related actual results.\nDetails of critical accounting estimates and judgements can be found\nin the notes to which they relate and include:\nTaxation\nNote B6\nMining tenements\nNote C2\nImpairment of assets\nNote C3\nExploration and evaluation assets\nNote C4\nRoyalty receivable\nNote C9\nProvisions\nNote C11\nBusiness combinations and disposals\nNote E1\nControl of Watagan\nNote E2",

      "text_content": "NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018\n108      YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\nB – PERFORMANCE\nB2 REVENUE\nAccounting Policies\nRevenue is recognised when the control of the products or services has transferred to the customer. Revenue is measured at the amount\nof consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring control of products or services to the customer.\nAmounts disclosed as revenue are net of returns, trade allowances, rebates and amounts collected on behalf of third parties.\nDescriptions of the Group’s performance obligations in contracts with customers and significant judgements applied in revenue recognition\nare as follows:\n(a) Sales revenue\n(i) Sale of coal\nThe Group produces and sells a range of thermal and metallurgical coal products. Revenue from the sale of coal is recognised when control\nof the product has transferred to the customer. Control of the product is considered transferred to the customer at the time of delivery,\nusually on a Free On Board (“FOB”) basis or a Cost and Freight (“CFR”) basis. For CFR contracts the performance obligation relating to\nfreight services is accounted for as a separate performance obligation. On occasion revenue from the sale of coal is recognised as the ship\npulls into harbour on a Free Alongside Ship (“FAS”) basis or from the stockpile on an ex-works basis.\nA receivable is recognised when control of the products is delivered as this is the point in time that the consideration is unconditional and\nonly the passage of time is required before the payment is due. Payment of the transaction price is usually due within 21 days of the date\nwhen control of the product is transferred to the customer. From time to time, the Group receives prepayments before control of the product\nhas transferred to the customer. Such prepayments are recognised as contract liabilities.\nSome of the Group’s coal sales contracts are long-term supply agreements which stipulate the nominal annual quantity and price\nnegotiation mechanism. For those contracts, the actual quantity and transaction price applicable for future shipments are only negotiated\nor determined prior to the beginning of, or a date which is after, each contract year or delivery period. The transaction price for a future\nshipment is based on, or derived from, a market price prevailing at the time of the future shipment. As the future market price for coal is\nhighly susceptible to factors outside the Group’s influence, the transaction price for a shipment is not readily determinable until or nearing\nthe time of the shipment. As a result, the Group has concluded that a contract with the customer does not exist for those shipments for\nwhich the actual delivery quantity and transaction price have not yet been negotiated or determined.\nThe transaction price for a shipment is often linked to a market index for the respective delivery period. For example, the transaction price\nmay be determined by reference to the average GlobalCOAL Newcastle Index for the delivery period. At the end of each reporting period,\nthe final average index price may not be available for certain shipments. In those situations, the Group uses “the expected value” method\nto estimate the amount of variable consideration based on the most recent average index price available for the relevant delivery period as\nof the end of the reporting periods and for those shipments, the Group has determined that a significant reversal in the amount of revenue\nrecognised will not occur.\n(b) Other revenue\n(i) Interest\nInterest income from a financial asset is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate\napplicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that\nasset’s net carrying amount. Interest income from a finance lease is recognised over the term of the lease based on a pattern reflecting a\nconstant periodic rate of return on the net investment in the lease.\n(ii) Mining services fees\nThe Group provides corporate support services, IT services and mining services which relate to the management of mines. The management\nand mining service agreements stipulate a fixed monthly service fee and payment of the service fees is usually due within 21 days after the\nend of each calendar month in which the service is rendered. Revenue from providing management and mining services is recognised in\neach month in which the services are rendered.\n(iii) Sea freight services\nWhen contracts for sale of coal include freight on a CFR basis the performance obligation associated with providing the shipping is\nseparately measured and recognised as the service is provided.\n(iv) Other\nOther primarily consists of dividends, rents, sub-lease rental and management fees. Dividends are recognised as revenue when the right to\nreceive payment is established, it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the Group and the amount\nof the dividend can be measured reliably. Rental income arising on land surrounding a mine site is accounted for on a straight-line basis over\nthe lease term. Contingent rental income is recognised as income in the periods in which it is earned.",

Employee benefits recognised in the profit or loss are net of recoveries.\n(ii) Superannuation\nContributions made by the Group under Australian legislation to contribute 9.5% of employees’ salaries and wages to the employees’\ndefined contribution superannuation funds are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.\n(iii) Wages and salaries, annual leave and sick leave\nLiabilities for employee benefits for wages, salaries, annual leave and accumulating sick leave that are expected to be wholly settled within\n12 months of the reporting date represent present obligations resulting from employees’ services provided to the reporting date and are\ncalculated at undiscounted amounts based on wage and salary rates that the Group expects to pay as at the reporting date including\nrelated on-costs, such as superannuation, workers’ compensation, insurance and payroll tax and are included in trade and other payables.\nNon-accumulating, non-monetary benefits such as housing and cars are expensed by the Group as the benefits are used by the employee.\nEmployee benefits payable later than 12 months have been measured at the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be\nmade for those benefits. In determining the liability, consideration is given to employee salary and wage increases and the probability that\nthe employee may satisfy any vesting requirements. Those cash flows are discounted using corporate bonds with terms to maturity that\nmatch the expected timing of cash flows attributable to employee benefits.\nAdditional Long Service Leave payments are made monthly to the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Corporation\nbased on the eligible monthly payroll of employees involved in the mining of black coal. Reimbursement is sought from the fund when long\nservice leave is paid to employees involved in the mining of black coal. An asset for the amount recoverable from the Coal Mining Industry\n(Long Service Leave Funding) Corporation is recognised in trade and other receivables.\nThese employee benefits are presented as current provisions as the Group has no unconditional right to deferred settlement for at least\n12 months after the end of the reporting period.\n(iv) Equity-settled share-based payments\nThe grant date fair value of equity-settled share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognised as an expense, with a\ncorresponding increase in equity, over the vesting period of the awards. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect\nthe number of awards for which related service and non-market performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount\nultimately recognised is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the\nvesting date. For share-based payment awards with market performance conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based payment\nis measured using a Black-Scholes option pricing model to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected\nand actual outcomes.\n(a) Employee benefits\n31 December\n2018\n$M\n31 December\n2017\n$M\nEmployee benefits\n464\n281\nShare-based payments\n16\n–\nSuperannuation contributions\n38\n21\nTotal employee benefits\n518\n302\nDuring 2018 $1 million of employee benefits were capitalised (2017: $17 million).\n(b) Key Management Personnel compensation\nRefer to the Remuneration Report contained in the Directors’ Report for details of the remuneration paid or payable to each member of the\nGroup’s Key Management Personnel (“KMP”) for the year ended 31 December 2018.\nThe total of remuneration paid to KMP of the Company and the Group during the year was as follows:\n31 December\n2018\n31 December\n2017\nShort-term employee benefits\n5,901,640\n9,265,818\nPost-employment benefits\n149,534\n149,362\nOther long-term benefits\n2,742,559\n1,950,142\n8,793,733\n11,365,322",

      "text_content": "NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      ANNUAL REPORT 2018      113\nB6 TAXATION\nAccounting Policy\nThe income tax expense or benefit for the period is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable income based on the applicable income\ntax rate enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period for each jurisdiction, adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets\nand liabilities attributable to temporary differences and to unused tax losses.\nDeferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and\nliabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for if it\narises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction\naffects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted\nor substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is\nrealised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable\namounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses. The carrying value of the deferred tax asset is reviewed at each\nreporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that future taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the\nasset to be recovered.\nDeferred tax liabilities and assets are recognised for taxable temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax bases of\ninvestments in controlled entities, except where the parent entity is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences\nand it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when the\ndeferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally\nenforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\nCurrent and deferred tax is recognised in the profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive\nincome or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.\nTax consolidation legislation\nYancoal Australia Ltd and its wholly owned Australian controlled entities have implemented the tax consolidation legislation for income tax\npurposes. The accounting policy in relation to this legislation is set out in Note E4.\nCritical accounting estimates and judgements\nThe Group is subject to income taxes in Australia. Significant judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes.\nDeferred tax assets, including those arising from unutilised tax losses, require the Group to assess the likelihood that the Group will generate\nsufficient taxable earnings in future periods, in order to utilise recognised deferred tax assets. Judgement is also required in respect of\nthe application of existing tax laws especially in relation to position adopted that may have an uncertain outcome. Assumptions about the\ngeneration of future taxable profits depend on management’s estimates of future cash flows. These estimates of future taxable income are\nbased on forecast cash flows from operations (which are impacted by production and sales volumes, coal prices, reserves, operating costs,\nclosure and rehabilitation costs, capital expenditure, and other capital management transactions). To the extent that future cash flows and\ntaxable income differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the Group to realise the net deferred tax assets recorded at the reporting date\ncould be impacted. In addition, future changes in tax laws could limit the ability of the Group to obtain tax deductions in future periods.\n(a) Income tax expense\n(i) Net tax expenses\n31 December\n2018\n$M\n31 December\n2017\n$M\nIncome tax expense\n(340)\n(84)\nIncome tax over provision in respect of prior years\n20\n2\n(320)\n(82)\nNet tax expense is attributable to:\nContinuing operations\n(320)\n(82)",

The cost\nincludes expenditure directly attributable to the acquisition of\nthe items and the estimated restoration costs associated with\nthe asset.\nSubsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or\nrecognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is\nprobable that future economic benefits associated with the item\nwill flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured\nreliably. The carrying amount of any component accounted for\nas a separate asset is derecognised when replaced. All other\nrepairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the\nreporting period in which they are incurred.\nMine development assets include all mining related development\nexpenditure that is not included under land, buildings and plant\nand equipment.\nThe open pit operations capitalise mine development costs\nincluding both direct and indirect costs incurred to remove\noverburden and other waste materials to enable access to the\ncoal seams during the development of a mine before commercial\nproduction commences, and during future development of\nnew open pit mining areas. Amortisation of those capitalised\ncosts over the life of the operation commences at the time that\ncommercial production begins for the mine for the new open pit\nmining area.\nUnderground mine development costs include both direct and\nindirect mining costs relating to underground longwall panel\ndevelopment and mains development (primary access/egress\nroads for the mine).\nMains development costs are capitalised net of the coal sales\nrevenue earned from coal extracted as part of the mains\ndevelopment process. These capitalised costs are amortised\nover the life of the mine if the roads service the entire mine or\nover the life of the panels accessible from those mains if shorter\nthan the mine life.\nA regular review is undertaken of each area of interest to\ndetermine the appropriateness of continuing to carry forward\nmine development costs in relation to that area of interest.\nAccumulated costs in relation to an abandoned area are written\noff in full in the period in which the decision to abandon the area\nis made.\nOpen cut\nDuring the commercial production stage of open pit operations,\nproduction stripping costs comprise the accumulation of\nexpenses incurred to enable access to the coal seam, and\ninclude direct removal costs (inclusive of an allocation of\noverhead expenditure) and machinery and plant running costs.\nProduction stripping costs are capitalised as part of an asset, if\nit can be demonstrated that it is probable that future economic\nbenefits will be realised, the costs can be reliably measured and\nthe entity can identify the component of the ore body for which\naccess has been improved. The asset is called a “stripping\nactivity asset” included in mine development.\nThe stripping activity asset is amortised on a systematic basis,\nover the expected useful life of the identified component of\nthe ore body that becomes more accessible as a result of the\nstripping activity. The units of production method shall be applied.\nProduction stripping costs that do not satisfy the asset\nrecognition criteria are expensed.\nDepreciation and amortisation\nThe depreciable amount of all fixed assets, excluding freehold\nland, is depreciated on a straight-line or units of production basis\nover the asset’s useful life to the Group based on life of mine\nplans and Joint Ore Reserves Committee (“JORC”) estimated\nreserves, commencing from the time the asset is held ready for\nuse. Leased assets are depreciated over the asset’s useful life\nor over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term\nif there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain\nownership at the end of the lease term. Leasehold improvements\nare depreciated over the period of the lease or estimated useful\nlife, whichever is the shorter, using the straight-line method.\nFor some assets, the useful life of the asset is linked to the level\nof production. In such cases, depreciation is charged on a units\nof production basis based on the recoverable reserves or the\nremaining useful hours. Alternatively, the straight-line method\nmay be used where this provides a suitable alternative because\nproduction is not expected to fluctuate significantly from one year\nto another.\nThe estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation\nmethod are reviewed at the end of each annual reporting\nperiod and any change in estimate is taken into account in the\ndetermination of remaining depreciation charges.\nThe estimated useful lives are as follows:\n––\nBuildings 10 – 25 years\n––\nMine development 10 – 40 years\n––\nPlant and equipment 2.5 – 40 years\n––\nLeased plant and equipment 2 – 20 years\nAn asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its\nrecoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than\nits estimated recoverable amount.\nAny gain or loss arising on the disposal of an item of property,\nplant and equipment is determined as the difference between\nthe sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is\nrecognised in profit or loss.\nSee Note C3 for further details on impairment of assets.\nC – OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES",

Mining\ntenements are amortised from the date when commercial production commences, or the date of acquisition. Amortisation is calculated\nover the life of the mine on a “units of production” method based on the Joint Ore Reserves Committee (“JORC”) estimated reserves.\nChanges in the annual amortisation rate resulting from changes in the remaining estimated reserves are applied on a prospective basis\nfrom the commencement of the next financial year. Every year the mining tenement’s carrying amount is compared to its recoverable\namount and assessed for impairment, or for possible reversals of prior year impairment.\nSee Note C3 for further details on the impairment of assets.\n31 December\n2018\n$M\n31 December\n2017\n$M\nOpening net book amount\n4,296\n2,128\nAcquisition through business combination\n128\n2,456\nTransfers from exploration and evaluation\n6\n26\nImpairment reversal\n–\n100\nAmortisation\n(188)\n(103)\nTransfer to assets classified as held for sale\n(24)\n(311)\nClosing net book amount\n4,218\n4,296\nCritical accounting estimates and judgements\nCoal reserves and resources\nThe Group estimates its coal resources and reserves based on information compiled by Competent Persons as defined by the Australasian\nCode for Reporting Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (December 2012), which is prepared by the Joint Ore\nReserves Committee (“JORC”) of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Australian Institute of Geoscientists and Minerals\nCouncil of Australia, known as the JORC 2012 Code, and Australian Securities Exchange (“ASX”) Listing Rules 2012.\nMineral Resources and Ore Reserves are based on geological information and technical data relating to the size, depth, quality of coal,\nsuitable production techniques and recovery rates. Such an analysis requires complex geological judgements to interpret the data.\nThe estimation of Recoverable Reserves is based on factors such as estimates of foreign exchange rates, coal price, future capital\nrequirements, rehabilitation obligations and production costs, along with geological assumptions and judgements made in estimating\nthe size and quality of the reserves. Management forms a view of forecast sales prices based on long-term forecast coal price data from\nmultiple external sources.\nThe external sources have determined their benchmark coal price forecasts having regard to the latest International Energy Agency (IEA)\nbase scenario and the Nationally Determined Contributions agreed under the Paris Agreement in 2015. This contemplates the global\nseaborne demand for thermal coal will remain relatively consistent until 2040 whilst the global seaborne demand for metallurgical coal will\nincrease up to 2040.\nA more rigorous international response to climate change under the Paris Agreement could negatively impact the Recoverable Reserves\nby lowering the forecast sales prices.\nAdditionally as the economic assumptions used may change and as additional geological information is produced during the operations of\na mine, estimates of reserves may change. The amount of reserves that may actually be mined in the future and the Group’s current reserve\nestimate may vary. Such changes may impact the Group’s reported financial position and results including:\n––\nthe carrying value of the exploration and evaluation assets, mine properties, property, plant and equipment and goodwill may be affected\ndue to changes in estimated future cash flows;\n––\ndepreciation and amortisation charges in the statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income may change where such\ncharges are determined using the units of production method, or where the useful life of the related assets change; and\n––\nthe carrying value of deferred income tax assets may change due to changes in the judgements regarding the existence of such assets\nand in estimates of the likely recovery of such assets.",

The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. Mining tenements and other\nnon-financial assets (excluding goodwill) that have previously suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at\nthe end of each reporting period.\nFor the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped into Cash-Generating Units (“CGUs”), being the lowest levels for which there\nare separately identifiable cash inflows which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. For the\npurposes of goodwill impairment testing, CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment\nis tested reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. The goodwill acquired in a business\ncombination, for the purpose of impairment testing, is allocated to CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.\nThe Group assesses impairment by evaluation of conditions and events specific to the Company that may be indicative of\nimpairment triggers.\n(ii) Other financial assets\nThe Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial\nassets is impaired. A financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective\nevidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a “loss event”) and that\nloss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be\nreliably estimated.\nIf there is evidence of impairment for any of the Group’s financial assets carried at amortised cost, the loss is measured as the difference\nbetween the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, excluding future credit losses that have not been\nincurred. The cash flows are discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The loss is recognised in profit or loss.\nCritical accounting estimates and judgements\nThe determination of fair value and value in use requires management to make estimates and assumptions about expected production\nand sales volumes, coal prices (considering current and historical prices, price trends and related factors), foreign exchange rates, coal\nresources and reserves (refer to Note C2), operating costs, closure and rehabilitation costs and future capital expenditure. These estimates\nand assumptions are subject to risk and uncertainty; hence there is a possibility that changes in circumstances will alter these projections,\nwhich may impact the recoverable amount of the assets. In such circumstances, some or all of the carrying amount of the assets may be\nfurther impaired or the impairment charge reduced with the impact recorded in the statement of profit or loss.\n(a) CGU assessment\nThe Group operates on a regional basis within NSW and as such the NSW mines are considered to be one CGU. From 2017, Hunter Valley\nOperations and Mount Thorley Warkworth have been included in the NSW regional CGU alongside Moolarben and Stratford/Duralie. Yarrabee\nand Middlemount are considered separate CGUs due to location and ownership structure.\n(b) Assessment of fair value\nEach CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal has been determined using a discounted cash flow model over the expected life of mine\n(18 – 42 years). The fair value model adopted has been categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\nC – OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES",

      "text_content": "NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      ANNUAL REPORT 2018      121\nThe key assumptions in the model include:\nKey assumptions\nDescription\nCoal prices\nThe Group’s cash flow forecasts are based on estimates of future coal prices, which assume benchmark\nprices will revert to the Group’s assessment of the long-term real coal prices of US$67 – US$104 per tonne\n(2017: US$65 – US$101 per tonne) for thermal and US$112 – US$217 per tonne (2017: US$110 – US$190\nper tonne) for metallurgical coal.\nThe Group receives long-term forecast coal price data from multiple external sources when determining its\nbenchmark coal price forecasts and then makes adjustments for specific coal qualities.\nThe external sources have determined their benchmark coal price forecasts having regard to the latest\nInternational Energy Agency (IEA) New Policy Scenario, the Nationally Determined Contributions submitted\nin the lead-up to the Paris Agreement in 2015 and National Energy Policies. This contemplates the global\nseaborne demand for thermal coal will remain relatively consistent until 2040 whilst the global seaborne demand\nfor metallurgical coal will increase up to 2040. Key risks to the outlooks are increasing decarbonisation trends,\ntrade disputes, protectionism, import control policies in China and investor behaviour to coal project financing.\nThe Group has considered the impacts of a more rigorous international response to climate change under the\nParis Agreement and notes that the average mine life required for the recoverable amount to continue to exceed\nthe book value, holding all inputs constant, including coal prices, is seven, seven and three years for the NSW,\nYarrabee and Middlemount CGUs, respectively. The NSW CGU has an 80% exposure to thermal coal and 20%\nexposure to metallurgical coal whilst Yarrabee and Middlemount are both metallurgical coal mines.\nThe Group concludes that whilst a more rigorous international response to climate change could reduce the\nfuture demand for coal the likely impacts of any such actions are not expected to materially impact during the\ntime periods noted above and hence would not result in the recoverable amount falling below book value.\nFor both thermal and metallurgical coal the Group’s forecast coal price is within the range of external\nprice forecasts.\nForeign exchange rates\nThe long-term AUD/USD forecast exchange rate of $0.75 (2017: $0.75) is based on external sources.\nThe year end AUD/USD exchange rate was $0.71 per the Reserve Bank of Australia.\nProduction and capital costs\nProduction and capital costs are based on the Group’s estimate of forecast geological conditions, stage\nof existing plant and equipment and future production levels.\nThis information is obtained from internally maintained budgets, the five-year business plan, life of mine models,\nlife of mine plans, JORC reports, and project evaluations performed by the Group in its ordinary course\nof business.\nCoal reserves and resources\nSee discussion at Note C2 Mining tenements for how the coal reserves and resources are determined.\nDiscount rate\nThe Group has applied a post-tax discount rate of 10.5% (2017: 10.5%) to discount the forecast future\nattributable post-tax cash flows.\nThe post-tax discount rate applied to the future cash flow forecasts represents an estimate of the rate the\nmarket would apply having regard to the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the\nfuture cash flow estimates have not been adjusted.\nThis rate is also consistent with the Group’s five-year business plan, life of mine models and project evaluations\nperformed in the ordinary course of business.\nBased on the above assumptions at 31 December 2018 the recoverable amount is determined to be above book value for all CGUs resulting\nin no further impairment.\nAt 31 December 2017, the remaining impairment provision at Moolarben of $100 million was reversed. Management assessed the following\nas being reasons for the reversal:\n––\nboth the NSW CGU and Moolarben standalone recoverable amounts are above book value;\n––\ncompletion of open cut expansions and commencement of underground mining operations during 2017 have derisked future cash flows\nand increased production from 8Mt in 2014 to approximately 17Mt of ROM coal; and\n––\ncurrent and life of mine operating costs and capital expenditure have decreased.\nThe impairment reversal was recognised through the profit and loss.\nImpairment provisions recorded as at 31 December 2018 is $72 million for Stratford and Duralie. Stratford and Duralie is included in the NSW\nregion CGU. Management may consider reversals of the impairment provision previously recognised if there is either an increase in the average\nlong-term real revenue over the life of the mine due to either an increase in USD coal prices, or a weakening of the AUD/USD foreign exchange\nrate or a combination of both, or reductions in the current and life of mine operating costs, capital expenditure requirements, or an increase in\nthe reserves.\nIn determining the value assigned to each key assumption, management has used external sources of information; the expertise of external\nconsultants; as well as the experience of experts within the Group to validate entity-specific assumptions such as coal reserves and resources.\nAdditionally various sensitivities have been determined and considered with respect to each of the key assumptions, further supporting the\nabove fair value conclusions.",

These costs are only carried forward where the right of tenure for the area of interest is current\nand to the extent that they are expected to be recouped through successful development and commercial exploitation, or alternatively,\nsale of the area, or where activities in the area have not yet reached a stage which permits reasonable assessment of the existence of\neconomically recoverable reserves and active and significant operations in, or in relation to, the area of interest are continuing.\nExploration and evaluation assets acquired in a business combination are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date. The carrying\namount of exploration and evaluation assets is assessed for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest the carrying amount of the\nassets may exceed their recoverable amount. A regular review is undertaken for each area of interest to determine the appropriateness of\ncontinuing to carry forward costs in relation to each area of interest. Accumulated costs in relation to an abandoned area are written off in\nfull in the period in which the decision to abandon the area is made.\nOnce the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the extraction of mineral resources in an area of interest are demonstrable,\nthe exploration and evaluation assets attributable to that area of interest are first tested for impairment and then reclassified to\nmining tenements.\nC – OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES",

The cash receipts will be recorded against the royalty receivable which will be decreased over time.

Rehabilitation of these areas is ongoing and in some cases will continue until 2060. The provision\nfor rehabilitation costs has been calculated based on the present value of the future costs expected to be incurred in\nrestoring affected mining areas, assuming current technologies.\nKey estimate and judgement:\nThe rehabilitation provision has been created based on management’s internal estimates and assumptions relating\nto the current economic environment, which management believes is a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the\nfuture liability.\nThese estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions; however actual\nrehabilitation costs will ultimately depend upon the future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works and\nthe timing of when the rehabilitation costs are incurred. Timing is dependent upon when the mines cease to produce\nat economically viable rates, which in turn will depend upon future coal prices, which are inherently uncertain.\nTake or pay\nIn acquiring part of a business or operation, an assessment is made on the fair value of the assets and liabilities under\nAASB 3 Business Combinations. Take or pay is the assessment of forecast excess capacity for port and rail contracts.\nA provision was recognised for the discounted estimated excess capacity. The provision has a finite life and will be\nreleased to profit or loss over the period in which excess capacity is realised.\nKey estimate and judgement:\nThe provision is recognised and estimated based on management’s assessment of contracted port capacity versus\nforecast usage. This involves making assumptions about the probability, amount and timing of an outflow of resources\nembodying economic benefits.\nC – OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES",

This condition is regarded as met only when the asset (or disposal group)\nis available for immediate sale or disposal in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales or disposals\nof such assets (or disposal groups) and the transaction is highly probable. Management must be committed to the transaction, which\nshould be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed transaction within one year from the date of classification.\nWhen the Group is committed to a sale plan or other transaction involving loss of control of a subsidiary, all of the assets and liabilities\nof that subsidiary are classified as held for sale when the criteria described above are met, regardless of whether the Group will retain a\nnon‑controlling interest in its former subsidiary after the sale.\nNon-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their previous carrying amount and fair\nvalue less costs to sell.\n31 December\n2018\n$M\n31 December\n2017\n$M\nCurrent assets\nInvestment in associate (i)\n–\n25\nInterest in joint ventures (ii)\n–\n531\nLand held for sale (iii)\n57\n57\nTotal current assets\n57\n613\nCurrent liabilities\nInterest in joint ventures (ii)\n–\n67\nTotal current liabilities\n–\n67\n(i)\t Investment in associate\nThe investment in associate was included in the asset sale agreement with Glencore as disclosed further in Note E1.

Glencore paid cash consideration\nof US$429 million to the Group for a 16.6% interest in HVO, and this amount was reduced by the net cash flows generated by the 16.6% HVO\ninterest from 1 September 2017 to the date of completion.

They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the reporting period which\nare classified as non-current assets.

The purchase price was\nfunded by way of a $1,363 million loan from Yancoal Australia Ltd to Watagan bearing interest of BBSY plus 7.06% with a maturity date of\n1 April 2025. The outstanding interest and principal of this loan is guaranteed by Yankuang Group Co. Ltd, the Group’s ultimate parent entity.\nWatagan can make prepayments of the outstanding loan balance with any such prepayment capable of redraw in the future.\nD2 INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES\nAccounting Policies\n(i) Interest-bearing liabilities\nInterest-bearing liabilities (excluding financial guarantees) are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs. They are subsequently\nmeasured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. US dollar interest-bearing loans are designated as a hedge instrument\nin a cash flow hedge (refer to note D7). Refer to Note F6(b) for detailed policies in relation to recognition, classification, measurement and\nderecognition of interest-bearing liabilities.\n(ii) Leases\nProperty, plant and equipment held by the Group under leases that transfer to the Group substantially all of the risks and rewards of\nownership are classified as finance leases.\nThe leased property, plant and equipment are initially measured at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present\nvalue of the minimum lease payments. Subsequently they are accounted for in accordance with the property, plant and equipment\naccounting policy.\nThe corresponding minimum lease payments are included in lease liabilities within interest-bearing liabilities. Each lease payment is allocated\nbetween finance cost and a reduction in the outstanding lease liability. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so\nas to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.\nThe net gains arising on the sale of an asset and the leasing back of the same asset using a finance lease are included as deferred income\nin the balance sheet and are released to the profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n(iii) Borrowing costs\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of assets, that necessarily take a substantial period of\ntime to prepare for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for\ntheir intended use or sale.\nAll other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.\nD – CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING",

The Group’s overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise\npotential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group. The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange\ncontracts to hedge certain risk exposures. Derivatives are exclusively used for hedging purposes and not as speculative instruments. The Group\nuses different methods to measure different types of risk to which it is exposed. These methods include sensitivity analysis in the case of foreign\nexchange, interest rate risk and other price risks, and ageing analysis for credit risk.\nThe Group holds the following financial instruments:\n(i)\t Cash and cash equivalents;\n(ii)\t Trade and other receivables (including WIPS);\n(iii)\t Trade and other payables;\n(iv)\t Interest-bearing liabilities, including bank loans and finance leases;\n(v)\t Available for sale investments;\n(vi)\t Royalty receivable;\n(vii)\tNon-contingent royalty receivable;\n(viii)\tNon-contingent royalty payable;\n(ix)\t Derivative financial instruments; and\n(x)\t Interest-bearing loan from associate.\n31 December\n2018\n$M\n31 December\n2017\n$M\nFinancial assets\nCash and cash equivalents\n1,031\n207\nLoans and receivables – amortised cost\nTrade and other receivables\n844\n1,131\nNon-contingent royalty receivable\n15\n–\nInterest-bearing loan to associates\n835\n712\nAssets at fair value through profit and loss\nRoyalty receivable\n193\n199\nWIPS\n–\n29\n2,918\n2,278\nFinancial liabilities\nAmortised cost\nTrade and other payables\n840\n758\nInterest-bearing liabilities\n4,124\n4,723\nNon-contingent royalty payable\n52\n160\n5,016\n5,641\nThe Board of Directors has overall responsibility for determining risk management objectives and policies and risk management is carried\nout by the Group Audit and Risk Management department along with the Group Treasury department. The Board provides written principles\nfor overall risk management, as well as policies covering specific areas such as the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate foreign\nexchange risk. These derivative instruments create an obligation or right that effectively transfers one or more of the risks associated with an\nunderlying financial instrument, asset or obligation.\nThe overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk and volatility in financial performance without unduly affecting\ncompetitiveness and flexibility. Further details regarding these policies are set out below.\n(a) Market risk\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, securities prices, and coal prices, will affect\nthe Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.\n(i) Foreign exchange risk\nThe Group operates entirely in Australia and its costs are primarily denominated in its functional currency, the Australian dollar. Export coal sales\nare denominated in US dollars and a strengthening of the Australian dollar against the US dollar has an adverse impact on earnings and cash\nflow settlement. Liabilities for some plant and equipment purchases and loans are denominated in currencies other than the Australian dollar\nand a weakening of the Australian dollar against other currencies has an adverse impact on earnings and cash flow settlement.\nThe hedging policy of the Group aims to protect against the volatility of cash expenditures or reduced collection in the abovementioned\ntransactions as well as to reduce the volatility of profit or loss for retranslation of US dollar denominated loans at each period end.\nD – CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING",

      "text_content": "NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      ANNUAL REPORT 2018      141\nHedging through bank issued instruments\nOperating foreign exchange risk that arises from firm commitments or highly probable transactions is managed through the use of bank issued\nforward foreign currency contracts. The Group hedges a portion of contracted US dollar sales receivables and asset purchases settled in\nforeign currencies in each currency to mitigate the adverse impact on cash flow due to the future rise or fall in Australian dollars against the\nrelevant currencies.\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in Other\nComprehensive Income in the hedging reserve until the anticipated underlying transaction occurs. Once the anticipated underlying transaction\noccurs, amounts accumulated in equity are recycled through the profit or loss or recognised as part of the cost of the asset to which it relates.\nThe ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised immediately\nin the profit or loss. In the current period, the loss relating to the ineffective portion was $nil (2017: $nil).\nNatural cash flow hedge\nThe Group currently does not use bank issued instruments to hedge foreign exchange risks in respect of US dollar denominated loans; however,\nthe scheduled repayment of the principal on US dollar loans is designated to hedge the cash flow risks on the portion of forecast US dollar\nsales that are not hedged through bank issued instruments (“natural cash flow hedge”). US dollar loan repayments up to a six-month period are\ndesignated to hedge the forecast US dollar sales during the same period after the designation of the hedge relationship based on a dollar for\ndollar basis until the hedge ratio reaches one.\nHedging effectiveness is determined by comparing the changes in the hedging instruments and hedged sales. Hedge ineffectiveness will occur\nwhen cash flows generated by sales transactions are lower than the forecast sales transaction. In cases of hedge ineffectiveness, gains or\nlosses in relation to the excess portion in the foreign exchange movement of the designated US dollar loan repayment will be recycled to profit\nor loss. The effective portion of changes in the hedging instruments will be recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve in Other Comprehensive\nIncome. When the sales transactions occur, amounts accumulated in equity are recycled through the profit or loss as an increase or decrease to\nsales revenue.\nRoyalty receivable\nThe royalty receivable from the Middlemount Joint Venture is estimated based on expected future cash flows that are dependent on sales\nvolumes, US dollar denominated coal prices and the US dollar foreign exchange rate (refer to Note C9).\nOther assets\nOther assets include the US$10 million associated with the Warkworth Call Option which was completed in March 2018, and the promissory\nnote receivable as discussed in Note C7(i). These balances are predominantly held in US dollars and expected to settle within 12 months.\nNon-contingent royalty payable and receivable\nAs part of the acquisition of Coal & Allied in 2017 the Company has agreed to make deferred non-contingent royalty payments to Rio Tinto Plc\n(“Rio Tinto”) in US dollars. As described in Note E1 27.9% of non-contingent royalty payable is received from Glencore.\nThe Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk at the end of the reporting period, expressed in Australian dollars, was as follows:\n31 December 2018\n31 December 2017\nUSD $M\nHKD $M\nUSD $M\nHKD $M\nCash and cash equivalents\n560\n189\n139\n–\nTrade and other receivables\n375\n–\n432\n–\nOther assets\n48\n–\n49\n–\nNon-contingent royalty receivable\n193\n–\n199\n–\nTrade and other payables\n(295)\n–\n(249)\n–\nInterest bearing liabilities\n(4,096)\n–\n(4,668)\n–\nNon-contingent royalty payable\n(52)\n–\n(167)\n–\nNet exposure\n(3,267)\n189\n(4,265)\n–\nSensitivity\nThe following table summarises the sensitivity of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities to a reasonable possible change in the US dollar\nexchange rate. The Group’s exposure to other foreign exchange movements is not material. The Group has used the observed range of actual\nhistorical rates for the preceding five-year period, with a heavier weighting placed on recently observed market data, in determining reasonably\npossible exchange movements to be used for the current year’s sensitivity analysis. Past movements are not necessarily indicative of future\nmovements. A 10% depreciation/appreciation of the Australian dollar against the US dollar would have (decreased)/increased equity and profit\nor loss after tax by the amounts shown below.

The royalty receivables from Middlemount are exposed to fluctuations in coal price. The Group currently does not have any derivative\nhedges in place against the movement in the spot coal price. Refer to Note D9(d)(iii) for the royalty receivable coal price sensitivity analysis.\nCoal sales are predominately provisionally priced initially. Provisionally priced sales are those for which price finalisation, referenced to the relevant\nindex, is outstanding at the reporting date. Provisional pricing mechanisms embedded within these sales arrangements have the character of a\ncommodity derivative and are carried at fair value through profit and loss as part of trade receivables. The final sales price is determined normally\nseven to 90 days after delivery to the customer. At 31 December 2018 there were $234 million of provisionally priced sales. If prices were to\nincrease by 10% provisionally priced sales would increase by $23 million.\n(iii) Interest rate risk\nThe Group is subject to interest rate risk that arises from borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash. Generally, no variable\ninterest is receivable or payable on the Group’s trade and other receivables or payables where applicable as they are fixed in nature and therefore\nthey are not exposed to the interest rate risk.\nThe Group’s cash flow interest rate risk for assets primarily arises from cash at bank and deposits subject to market bank rates. Floating rate\nborrowings bearing LIBOR rates are re-set on a quarterly basis.\nThe Group’s exposure to interest rate risk and the weighted average interest rate is set out as below:\n31 December 2018\n31 December 2017\nWeighted average\ninterest rate\n%\nBalance\n$M\nWeighted average\ninterest rate\n%\nBalance\n$M\nCash and cash equivalents\n1.4%\n1,030\n1.3%\n207\nRestricted cash\n–\n–\n3.0%\n1\nBank loans and other borrowings\n5.9%\n2,572\n5.0%\n3,141\nInterest-bearing loan to associate\n9.1%\n835\n8.9%\n712\nD – CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING",

As at\n31 December 2018 the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk which will cause a financial loss to the Group due to failure to discharge\nan obligation by the counterparties and financial guarantees provided by the Group is arising from the carrying amount of the respective\nrecognised financial assets as stated in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the amount of contingent liabilities in relation to financial\nguarantees issued by the Group as disclosed in Note D8.\nIn order to minimise credit risk, the management of the Group has delegated a team responsible for determination of credit limits, credit\napprovals and other monitoring procedures to ensure that follow-up action is taken to recover overdue debts. In addition, the Group reviews\nthe recoverable amount of each individual trade debt at the end of the reporting period to ensure that adequate impairment losses are made\nfor irrecoverable amounts. In this regard, the Directors consider that the Group’s credit risk is significantly reduced. The Group maintains its\ncash and cash equivalents with reputable banks. Therefore, the Directors consider that the credit risk for such amounts is minimal.\nIn assessing the Expected Credit Losses (“ECL”) of trade receivables management assesses historical write-offs of trade receivables, ageing\nof debtors and whether sufficient credit enhancement is provided by customers (letters of credit and bank guarantees). If the ageing of trade\nreceivables significantly increased then the recognition of ECL would need to be reassessed.\nReceivables will only be written off if there is demonstrable evidence that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.\nThere was no provision for lifetime or 12-month ECL recognised for trade receivables as at 31 December 2018 as there are minimal aged debts.\nThe credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited as the counterparties are banks with credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating\nagencies that are at least investment grade.\nCredit risk in trade receivables is managed in the following ways:\n(i)\t payment terms and credit limits are set for individual customers;\n(ii)\t a risk assessment process is used for all customers; and\n(iii)\t letters of credit are required for those customers assessed as posing a higher risk.\nAs disclosed in Note D2(a)(i) the minimum average balance of AU$25 million per day and at month end AU$50 million is required to be held\nin the Lender Accounts of the Syndicated Facility which is not available for use on those days.\nThe maximum exposure to credit risk on financial assets which have been recognised in the balance sheet is their carrying amount less\nimpairment provision, if any, as set out below.\n31 December\n2018\n$M\n31 December\n2017\n$M\nCash and cash equivalents\n1,031\n207\nTrade and other receivables\n844\n1,131\n1,875\n1,338\nIncluded in trade and other receivables are significant customers located in Singapore, Australia, Japan and Taiwan that account for 18%, 17%,\n16% and 14% of trade receivables respectively (2017: Singapore 30%, Japan 23%, Australia 14% and Hong Kong 8%).\nThe top five customers included in trade receivables with the largest gross receivable balance as at 31 December 2018 account for 33% of\ntrade receivables (2017: 27%).",

These valuation\ntechniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are\nobservable, the instrument is included in Level 2.\nIf one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3. This is the case for the\nroyalty receivable and WIPS.\n(iii) Fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3)\nThe following table presents the changes in Level 3 instruments for the year ended 31 December 2018:\n31 December\n2018\nRoyalty\nReceivable\n$M\n31 December\n2017\nRoyalty\nReceivable\n$M\nOpening balance\n199\n199\nCash received/receivable\n(31)\n(29)\nUnwinding of the discount\n21\n21\nRemeasurement of the royalty receivable recognised in profit and loss\n4\n8\nClosing balance\n193\n199\nRoyalty receivable\nThe fair value of the royalty receivable is the fair value of the right to receive a royalty of 4% of Free on Board Trimmed Sales from the\nMiddlemount mine. The financial asset has a finite life being the life of the Middlemount mine and will be measured on a fair value basis.\nThe fair value is determined using the discounted future cash flows that are dependent on the following unobservable inputs: forecast sales\nvolumes, coal prices and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The forecast sales volumes are based on the internally maintained budgets,\nfive‑year business plan and life of mine models. The forecast coal prices and long-term exchange rates are based on external data consistent\nwith the data used for impairment assessments (refer to Note C3). The risk-adjusted post-tax discount rate used to determine the future cash\nflows is 10.0%.\nThe estimated fair value could increase significantly if the following unobservable inputs of sales volumes and coal prices were higher and if the\nAustralian dollar weakens against the US dollar. The estimated fair value would also increase if the risk-adjusted discount rate was lower.\nSensitivity\nThe following tables summarise the sensitivity analysis of royalty receivable.

The consideration transferred\nfor the acquisition of a subsidiary comprises the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued\nby the Group. The consideration transferred also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration arrangement and the fair value of\nany pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred including stamp duty. Identifiable assets\nacquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at their\nfair values at the acquisition date.\nThe excess of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition date fair value\nof any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets acquired is recorded as\ngoodwill. If those amounts are less than the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the subsidiary acquired and the measurement of all\namounts has been reviewed, the difference is recognised directly in profit or loss as a gain on acquisition of subsidiaries.\nCritical accounting estimates and judgements\nAcquisition accounting\nAccounting for acquisition of businesses requires judgement and estimates in determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities.\nTechniques used to determine the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities include an income and cost approach for mining tenements\nand depreciated replacement cost for the valuation of property, plant and equipment.\nThe relevant accounting standard allows the fair value of assets acquired to be refined for a window of one year after the acquisition date,\nand judgement is required to ensure the adjustments made reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed\nas of the acquisition date. The adjustments made on fair value of assets are retrospective in nature and have an impact on goodwill or gain\nrecognised on acquisition.\n(a) Acquisition of 4% of Moolarben\n(i) Summary of acquisition\nOn 30 November 2018, Moolarben Coal Mine Pty Ltd, a 100% owned subsidiary of Yancoal Australia Ltd, acquired a 4% interest in Moolarben\nCoal Joint Venture (“Moolarben JV”) from Kores Australia Moolarben Coal Pty Ltd (“Kores”). The Moolarben JV is accounted for as a joint\noperation. With the 4% acquisition the Group now holds an 85% interest in the Moolarben JV. The cash consideration paid and payable\nwas $84 million, split over four instalments of $21 million each, and reduced by a $21 million effective date adjustment whereby the cash\nconsideration was reduced by 4% of the Moolarben JV’s net cash inflow from the date of the sales agreement (15 April 2018) to completion.\n(ii) Assets and liabilities acquired\nDetails of the purchase consideration and the net assets and liabilities acquired of the additional interest in the Moolarben JV are as follows:\n$M\nPurchase consideration:\nPurchase price\n84\nEffective date adjustment\n(21)\nTotal consideration\n63\nGain on acquisition of interest in joint operation\n–\nFair value of net identifiable assets acquired\n63\nE – GROUP STRUCTURE",

If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2018, consolidated revenue and net profit before tax for the period ended\n31 December 2018 would have been $333 million and $160 million respectively. These amounts have been calculated using the Group’s\naccounting policies.\n(d) Update on acquisition of Coal & Allied Industries Ltd\nOn 1 September 2017, the Group acquired the shares in Coal & Allied from wholly owned subsidiaries of Rio Tinto. The total consideration\npayable was $3,547 million. The accounting for the Coal & Allied acquisition was determined on a provisional basis at 31 December 2017.\nDuring the current year, adjustments have been made to the provisional acquisition accounting of Coal & Allied. This resulted in an increase\nin provisions of $8 million offset by increases in mining tenements of $1 million and intangible assets of $1 million together with the resulting\ndeferred tax impacts. Deferred tax assets increased by $2 million and deferred tax liabilities decreased by $4 million. The changes have resulted\nfrom further analysis of agreements and the nature and status of assets that existed as at the acquisition date that, if known, would have\naffected the measurement of the amounts recognised as at the date of acquisition.\nThe accounting for the acquisition is now final as at 31 December 2018.\nE2 INTERESTS IN OTHER ENTITIES\nAccounting Policies\n(i) Associates\nAssociates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control or joint control, generally accompanying a\nshareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of\naccounting, after initially being recognised at cost. The Group’s investments in associates include goodwill identified on acquisition.\nThe Group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in profit or loss, and its share of post-acquisition\nother comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted\nagainst the carrying amount of the investment. Dividends receivable from associates are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount\nof the investment.\n(ii) Joint arrangements\nA joint arrangement is a contractual arrangement whereby two or more parties undertake economic activities under joint control. Joint\ncontrol exists only when the strategic, financial and operational policy decisions relating to the activities of the joint arrangement require the\nunanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\nA joint arrangement is either a joint operation or a joint venture. The structure of each joint arrangement is analysed to determine whether\nthe joint arrangement is a joint operation or a joint venture. The classification of a joint arrangement is dependent on the rights and\nobligations of the parties to the arrangement.\nJoint operations\nThe Group recognises its proportional right to the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations and its share of any\njointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These have been incorporated in the financial statements under the\nappropriate headings.\nJoint ventures\nA joint venture is structured through a separate vehicle and the parties have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Joint ventures\nare accounted for using the equity method where the assets and liabilities will be aggregated into one line item on the face of the\nconsolidated balance sheet, after adjusting for the share of profit or loss after tax, which is shown as a separate line item on the face of\nthe Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income, after adjusting for amounts recognised directly in equity.\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures\nWhen the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture or associate equals or exceeds its interest in the joint venture or associate (which\nincludes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the joint venture), the Group does not\nrecognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture or associate.\nUnrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures or associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest\nin the joint ventures or associates. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the\nasset transferred. Accounting policies of the joint ventures or associates have been changed where necessary, to ensure consistency with\nthe policies adopted by the Group.\nCritical accounting judgements\nThere is significant judgement in assessing whether the Group controls Watagan; even though it holds 100% of the nominal share capital.\nAn assessment has been made that in accordance with the accounting standards the Group does not control Watagan as it is not able to\ndirect the relevant activities of Watagan and accounts for its interest in Watagan as an associate.",

On 18 February 2016, the\nGroup executed a Bond Subscription Agreement, together with other agreements (the “Watagan Agreements”) that, on completion, transferred\nthe Group’s interest in three of its 100% owned NSW coal mining operations, being the Austar, Ashton and Donaldson coal mines (the “three\nmines”), to Watagan for a purchase price of $1,363.4 million (an amount equal to the book value of the three mines at completion). The purchase\nprice was funded by way of a $1,363.4 million loan from Yancoal Australia Ltd to Watagan bearing interest at BBSY plus 7.06% with a maturity\ndate of 1 April 2025. The outstanding interest and principal of this loan is guaranteed by Yankuang Group Co., Ltd (“Yankuang”), the Group’s\nultimate parent entity. The completion date of the transaction was 31 March 2016.\nOn completion Watagan issued US$775 million of secured debt bonds with a term of approximately nine years to three external financiers\n(“Bondholders”). The Bondholders receive interest on the face value outstanding on the bonds comprising a fixed interest component, as well as\na variable interest component that is tied to the EBITDA performance of Watagan. As a result of the terms of the Watagan Agreements, it was\ndetermined that the Bondholders obtained accounting control of Watagan; accordingly, the Group de-consolidated Watagan.\nThis change in accounting control was determined to occur on the issuance date of the bonds on the basis that the Bondholders obtained\npower over the key operating and strategic decisions of Watagan and no longer resided with the Group. Specifically, those powers were\ntransferred to the Bondholders under the terms of the Watagan Agreements as the Bondholders were given control of Watagan’s Board of\nDirectors via appointment of the majority of Directors. This change in accounting control resulted in the Group de-consolidating the results of\nWatagan from the transaction completion date and the Group began to equity account for its 100% equity interest in Watagan as an associate,\ngiven the Group retains significant influence in Watagan.\nOn 4 January 2019 BOCI (one of the Bondholders) notified Watagan and Yankuang that it was exercising its put option over US$200 million\nof bonds. As a consequence, Yankuang will become the bondholder of the put bonds following completion of the purchase of those bonds\nby Yankuang expected to occur on or around 1 April 2019. No security will be given by Watagan in favour of Yankuang. As the put bonds\nrepresent less than 50.1% of the face value of the bonds, and the put option was not exercised by the instructing bondholder, the put option\nis not deemed to have been exercised as to all the bonds, nor has the Group regained accounting control of Watagan. Accordingly, the Group\ncontinues to equity account its interest in Watagan.\nWhilst Watagan is equity accounted rather than consolidated for accounting purposes, as a result of the Group’s ongoing 100% equity\nownership it remains within the Group’s tax consolidated group.\nE – GROUP STRUCTURE",

These losses have not\nbeen recognised as the accumulated losses exceed the value of the\ninvestment by the Group.\nThe book value of Watagan’s non-current assets of $1,654 million\nincludes $743 million, $390 million and $388 million for the Ashton,\nAustar and Donaldson mines, respectively.\nAs noted in the Directors’ Report Austar was subject to prohibition\nnotices issued by the Resource Regulator that restricted current\noperations in Bellbird South, however as announced on 7 August\n2018 these notices have now been lifted. Ongoing work is being\nundertaken by Watagan in respect of the very challenging geological\nand geotechnical conditions at the Austar mine, including both the\nBellbird South and Stage 3 areas that may have a significant adverse\nimpact on future commercial operations. The future prospects of the\nAustar mine are therefore uncertain, and its future carrying value will\ndepend upon the work currently being conducted by Watagan and\nits internal and external advisors (Austar Review). If it is determined\nthat the mine is unable to return to previously forecast levels of\nproduction, there is a need to proceed to a permanent shutdown, or\nthere are materially negative changes to other operating assumptions,\nincluding coal prices, exchange rates, operating costs or capital\nexpenditure, it is likely that the fair value of that mine, and therefore\nof Watagan, would be reduced materially. In that event, a material\nimpairment charge may be recognised. Donaldson remains on care\nand maintenance and work remains ongoing to explore potential\nfuture mining operations.\nThe value of the non-current assets in the Watagan balance sheet has\nthus been assessed on an aggregated basis, including that:\n––\nAustar returns to normal development and production in the Stage\n3 area on completion of mining in Bellbird South, this position will\nhave to be reassessed on completion of the Austar Review; and\n––\nDonaldson will recommence operations at some time in the future\nwhich is management’s current intention.\nThe key assumptions in the fair value model of Watagan are\nconsistent with those disclosed in Note C3 noting that: (i) the Group’s\nassessment of the long-term coal prices of USD67 – USD125 per\ntonne for thermal coal and USD112 – USD150 per tonne from\nmetallurgical coal for Watagan mines is at the top of the range of\nexternal forecasts; and (ii) to reflect the increased operational risks\nwhen determining the recoverable amount of the Watagan mines a\n3.5% risk premium has been applied to the discount rate, increasing\nto 14%.\nIf it is determined that either or both Austar or Donaldson are\nunable to restart operations or return to previously forecast levels of\nproduction or there are materially negative changes to other operating\nassumptions, impacting all three mines, including coal prices,\nexchange rates, operating costs, capital expenditure, geological\nconditions, approvals or changes to existing lease conditions or\nregulatory outcomes, it is likely that the fair value of these mines would\nbe reduced materially. Any impairment of these assets of Watagan\nwould increase Watagan’s net asset deficit.\nIn that event, an impairment may be recognised by the Group on its\nloan receivable from Watagan; refer to Note D1 for details on the loan,\nor on the future reconsolidation of Watagan.\nSensitivities\nApart from the geological and geotechnical issues noted at Austar and\nthe ongoing work on recommencing mining at Donaldson that directly\nimpact the physical and cost inputs, the most sensitive input to the\nfair value model of Watagan is forecast revenue, which is primarily\ndependent on estimated future coal prices and the AUD:USD forecast\nexchange rate, and the discount rate.\n2018\nWatagan\n$M\nBook Value\n1,046\nRecoverable Amount\n1,073\nHead Room\n27\nUS$ Coal Price (i)\n+10%\n371\n–10%\n(373)\nExchange Rate (ii)\n+5 cents\n(228)\n–5 cents\n269\nDiscount Rate (iii)\n+50 bps\n(52)\n–50 bps\n55\n(i)\t \u0007This represents change in recoverable amount due to +/– 10%\nchange to our coal price assumption.\n(ii)\t \u0007This represents the change in recoverable amount due to a\n+/– 5 cents change to the long-term US$:A$ foreign exchange\nrate adopted.\n(iii)\t \u0007This represents the change in recoverable amount due to a\n+/– 50bps change in discount rate adopted.\nPort Waratah Coal Services Ltd\nThe Group holds a direct shareholding in Port Waratah Coal Services\nLtd (“PWCS”) of 30% (2017: 30%).

The final dividend will be paid on 30 April 2019.\n––\nAs announced 25 February 2019, Yancoal pre-paid a further\nUS$500 million in loans, reducing its total debt liabilities by\nUS$1.4 billion since September 2017. The pre-payment consists\nof US$250 million in pre-paid loans from Bank of China and China\nConstruction Bank, and US$250 million in pre-paid Yanzhou-\nrelated loans.\nF6 OTHER SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n(a) Foreign currency transactions\n(i) Functional and presentation currency\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s\nentities are measured using the currency of the primary economic\nenvironment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”).\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in Australian\ndollars, which is the Group’s functional and presentation currency,\nexcept for Yancoal SCN Limited which has US dollars as its\nfunctional currency.\nFor the purpose of presenting these consolidated financial statements,\nthe assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are\ntranslated into Australian dollars using exchange rates prevailing at the\nend of the reporting period. Income and expense items are translated\nat the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates\nfluctuated significantly during that period, in which case the exchange\nrates at the dates of the transactions are used. Exchange differences\narising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and\naccumulated in equity.\n(ii) Transactions and balances\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional\ncurrency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the\ntransactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the\nsettlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end\nexchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in\nforeign currencies are recognised in profit or loss, except when they\nare deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges.\nNon-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign\ncurrency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when\nthe fair value was determined. Translation differences on assets and\nliabilities carried at fair value are reported as part of the fair value gain\nor loss. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical\ncost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at\nthe date of the transaction.\n(b) Financial instruments\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when a Group\nentity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair\nvalue. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition\nor issue of financial assets and financial liabilities are added to\nor deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial\nliabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition.\n(i) Financial assets\nAll regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognised\nand derecognised on a trade date basis. Regular way purchases or\nsales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of\nassets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in\nthe marketplace.\nAll recognised financial assets are subsequently measured in their\nentirety at either amortised cost or fair value, depending on the\nclassification of the financial assets.\nClassification of financial assets\nDebt instruments that meet the following conditions are subsequently\nmeasured at amortised cost:\n––\nthe financial asset is held within a business model whose objective\nis to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows;\nand\n––\nthe contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified\ndates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and\ninterest on the principal amount outstanding.\nAmortised cost and effective interest method\nThe effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised\ncost of a debt instrument and of allocating interest income over the\nrelevant period.\nFor financial instruments the effective interest rate is the rate that\nexactly discounts estimated future cash receipts (including all fees\nand points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective\ninterest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts)\nexcluding ECL, through the expected life of the debt instrument, or,\nwhere appropriate, a shorter period, to the gross carrying amount of\nthe debt instrument on initial recognition.\nThe amortised cost of a financial asset is the amount at which the\nfinancial asset is measured at initial recognition minus the principal\nrepayments, plus the cumulative amortisation using the effective\ninterest method of any difference between that initial amount and the\nmaturity amount, adjusted for any loss allowance. On the other hand,\nthe gross carrying amount of a financial asset is the amortised cost of\na financial asset before adjusting for any loss allowance.\nInterest income is recognised using the effective interest method\nfor debt instruments measured subsequently at amortised cost.\nFor financial instruments interest income is calculated by applying\nthe effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of a financial\nasset, except for financial assets that have subsequently become\ncredit-impaired. For financial assets that have subsequently become\ncredit-impaired, interest income is recognised by applying the\neffective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset. If, in\nsubsequent reporting periods, the credit risk on the credit-impaired\nfinancial instrument improves so that the financial asset is no longer\ncredit-impaired, interest income is recognised by applying the effective\ninterest rate to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset.\nInterest income is recognised in profit or loss and is included in the\n“other revenue” line item.\nFinancial assets at FVTPL\nFinancial assets that do not meet the criteria for being measured at\namortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income\n(”FVTOCI”) are measured at FVTPL. Specifically:\n––\nInvestments in equity instruments are classified as at FVTPL,\nunless the Group designates an equity investment that is neither\nheld for trading nor contingent consideration arising from a\nbusiness combination as at FVTOCI on initial recognition.",

      "text_content": "NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      ANNUAL REPORT 2018      165\n––\nDebt instruments that do not meet the amortised cost criteria\nor the FVTOCI criteria are classified as at FVTPL. In addition,\ndebt instruments that meet either the amortised cost criteria or\nthe FVTOCI criteria may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial\nrecognition if such designation eliminates or significantly reduces\na measurement or recognition inconsistency that would arise from\nmeasuring assets or liabilities or recognising the gains and losses\non them on different bases. The Group has not designated any\ndebt instruments as at FVTPL.\nFinancial assets at FVTPL are measured at fair value, with changes\nin fair value arising from remeasurement recognised in profit or loss.\nThe net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss excludes any dividend\nor interest earned on the financial assets and is included in the “Other\nincome” line item.\nSignificant increase in credit risk\nIn assessing whether the credit risk on a financial instrument has\nincreased significantly since initial recognition, the Group compares\nthe risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument as at the\nreporting date with the risk of a default occurring on the financial\ninstrument as at the date of initial recognition. In making this\nassessment, the Group considers both quantitative and qualitative\ninformation that is reasonable and supportable, including historical\nexperience and forward-looking information that is available without\nundue cost or effort. Forward-looking information considered\nincludes the future prospects of the industries in which the Group’s\ndebtors operate, obtained from economic expert reports, financial\nanalysts, governmental bodies, relevant think-tanks and other similar\norganisations, as well as consideration of various external sources of\nactual and forecast economic information that relate to the Group’s\ncore operations.\nIn particular, the following information is taken into account when\nassessing whether credit risk has increased significantly since\ninitial recognition:\n––\nan actual or expected significant deterioration in the financial\ninstrument’s external (if available) or internal credit rating;\n––\nsignificant deterioration in external market indicators of credit risk\nfor a particular financial instrument, e.g. a significant increase in the\ncredit spread, the credit default swap prices for the debtor, or the\nlength of time or the extent to which the fair value of a financial\nasset has been less than its amortised cost;\n––\nexisting or forecast adverse changes in business, financial or\neconomic conditions that are expected to cause a significant\ndecrease in the debtor’s ability to meet its debt obligations;\n––\nan actual or expected significant deterioration in the operating\nresults of the debtor;\n––\nsignificant increases in credit risk on other financial instruments\nof the same debtor; and\n––\nan actual or expected significant adverse change in the regulatory,\neconomic or technological environment of the debtor that\nresults in a significant decrease in the debtor’s ability to meet\nits debt obligations.\nIrrespective of the outcome of the above assessment, the Group\npresumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased\nsignificantly since initial recognition when contractual payments are\nmore than 30 days past due, unless the Group has reasonable and\nsupportable information that demonstrates otherwise.\nDespite the foregoing, the Group assumes that the credit risk on\na financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial\nrecognition if the financial instrument is determined to have low credit\nrisk at the reporting date. A financial instrument is determined to have\nlow credit risk if i) the financial instrument has a low risk of default, ii)\nthe borrower has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow\nobligations in the near term and iii) adverse changes in economic and\nbusiness conditions in the longer term may, but will not necessarily,\nreduce the ability of the borrower to fulfil its contractual cash flow\nobligations. The Group considers a financial asset to have low credit\nrisk when it has an internal or external credit rating of “investment\ngrade” as per globally understood definition.\nThe Group regularly monitors the effectiveness of the criteria used to\nidentify whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk and\nrevises them as appropriate to ensure that the criteria are capable\nof identifying significant increase in credit risk before the amount\nbecomes past due.\nDefinition of default\nThe Group considers the following as constituting an event of default\nfor internal credit risk management purposes as historical experience\nindicates that receivables that meet either of the following criteria are\ngenerally not recoverable:\n––\nwhen there is a breach of financial covenants by the counterparty;\nor\n––\ninformation developed internally or obtained from external sources\nindicates that the debtor is unlikely to pay its creditors, including\nthe Group, in full (without taking into account any collaterals held\nby the Group).\nIrrespective of the above analysis, the Group considers that default\nhas occurred when a financial asset is more than 90 days past due\nunless the Group has reasonable and supportable information to\ndemonstrate that a more lagging default criterion is more appropriate.\nCredit-impaired financial assets\nA financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that\nhave a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of\nthat financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is\ncredit‑impaired includes observable data about the following events:\na)\t significant financial difficulty of the issuer or the borrower;\nb)\t a breach of contract, such as a default or past due event;\nc)\t \u0007the lender(s) of the borrower, for economic or contractual reasons\nrelating to the borrower’s financial difficulty, having granted to the\nborrower a concession(s) that the lender(s) would not otherwise\nconsider; or\nd)\t \u0007it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter into\nbankruptcy or other financial reorganisation.\nMeasurement and recognition of ECL\nThe measurement of ECL is a function of the probability of default,\nloss given default (i.e. the magnitude of the loss if there is a default)\nand the exposure at default. The assessment of the probability of\ndefault and loss given default is based on historical data adjusted by\nforward-looking information as described above. As for the exposure\nat default, for financial assets, this is represented by the assets’ gross\ncarrying amount at the reporting date.\nFor financial assets, the ECL is estimated as the difference between all\ncontractual cash flows that are due to the Group in accordance with\nthe contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive,\ndiscounted at the original effective interest rate.",

The Group has also used the practical expedient of a\nprovisions matrix using fixed rates to approximate the expected credit\nlosses. These provisions are considered representative across all\nbusiness and geographic segments of the Group based on historical\ncredit loss experience and considered future information.\n(ii) Financial liabilities and equity instruments\nDebt and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified as\neither financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance\nof the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial\nliability and an equity instrument.\nAn equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest\nin the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.\nFinancial liabilities\nThe Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables,\nnon-contingent royalty payable, and interest-bearing liabilities which\nare initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at\namortised cost, using the effective interest method.\nEffective interest method\nThe effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised\ncost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the\nrelevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly\ndiscounts estimated future cash payments (including all fees paid\nor points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective\ninterest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts)\nthrough the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate,\na shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.\nInterest expense is recognised on an effective interest basis.\nEquity instruments\nAn equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest\nin the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity\ninstruments issued by the Company are recognised at the proceeds\nreceived, net of direct issue costs.\nSCNs issued by the Group, which include no contractual obligation\nfor the Group to deliver cash or another financial asset to the holders\nor to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with the holders\nunder conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group,\nare classified as equity instruments and are initially recorded at the\nproceeds received.\nAccounting for derivative financial instruments and\nhedging activities\nDerivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date when a\nderivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at\ntheir fair value at the end of the reporting period. The resulting gain or\nloss is recognised in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is\ndesignated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the\ntiming of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the\nhedge relationship. The Group designates certain derivatives as either:\n(i) hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities (fair value\nhedges); or (ii) hedges of highly probable forecast transactions (cash\nflow hedges).\nThe fair values of various derivative instruments used for hedging\npurposes are disclosed in Note D9. The full fair value of a hedging\nderivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the\nremaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months and as\na current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged\nitem is less than 12 months.\nAt the inception of the hedging relationship the Group documents\nthe relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged\nitem, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for\nundertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception\nof the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether\nthe hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly\neffective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the\nhedged item.\n(i) Cash flow hedge\nThe effective portions of changes in the fair value of derivatives that\nare designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised\nin other comprehensive income and accumulated in cash flow\nhedge reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion\nis recognised immediately in profit or loss.\nAmounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and\naccumulated in cash flow hedge reserve in equity are reclassified to\nprofit or loss in the periods when the hedged items are recognised\nin profit or loss.\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the\nhedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold,\nterminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge\naccounting. Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive\nincome and accumulated in equity at that time remains in equity and\nis recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised\nin profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected\nto occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised\nimmediately in profit or loss.\n(ii) Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting and those not\ndesignated as hedging instruments\nChanges in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not\nqualify for hedge accounting and those not designated as hedges are\nrecognised immediately in profit or loss.\nF – OTHER INFORMATION",

The difference\nbetween the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and\nthe consideration paid and payable is recognised in profit or loss.\nF7 NEW AND AMENDED STANDARDS ADOPTED BY THE GROUP\n(i) New and amended standards adopted by the Group\nEffective from 1 January 2018 the Group adopted the new standards\nincluding AASB 9 Financial Instruments and AASB 15 Revenue from\nContracts with Customers. The impact of adopting these standards is\nas follows:\nAASB 9 Financial Instruments\nThe adoption of AASB 9 Financial Instruments resulted in the\nfollowing changes:\nFinancial Assets\nAll financial assets that were classified as loans and receivables were\nclassified as assets held at amortised cost except for the Wiggins\nIsland Preferences Shares (“WIPS”) which have been revalued to nil\nat 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: $29 million). These have\nbeen reclassified as assets held at fair value through profit or loss\n(“FVTPL”). The valuation at 31 December 2017 did not need adjusting\nas the fair value approximated the carrying amount. The WIPS are still\nclassified as trade and other receivables.\nFinancial Liabilities\nClassification of financial liabilities remains the same as under the old\naccounting standards. The measurement of financial liabilities has\nrequired an adjustment to non-current interest-bearing liabilities as\nthere was a non-substantial modification to the Bank of China facilities\ncompleted in August 2017. This involved modifying the terms of this\nloan to change the interest structure from US Libor +2.8% increasing\nto US Libor +5% over time, adjusted to US Libor +3.1% applicable\nfrom June 2017 and adjustments to agency fees over the remaining\nloan life.\nUnder AASB 9, a key determinant of whether a modification is\nconsidered substantial or non-substantial is a quantitative assessment\nof whether the discounted cash flows under the new terms, using\nthe original effective interest rate, is at least 10% different from the\ndiscounted remaining cash flows of the original financial liability.\nQualitatively the modification is non-substantial because there has\nbeen no change in the counterparty to the loan and a quantitative\nassessment has been performed. The modification in 2017 is non-\nsubstantial, or less than 10% of the net present value of the original\nloan balance, with the net present value of the changes being a\n$31 million reduction in cash flows or 0.9% over the life of the loan.\nThis adjustment is recognised as a gain in other income and will be\nunwound as an interest expense on an effective interest rate basis\nwith immediate unwinds occurring on loan repayments. The unwind\nfor the year ending 31 December 2017 would have been $7 million\nwhich included an immediate unwind associated with the repayment\nof US$150 million of the facilities in December 2017.\nAs the Group is applying AASB 9 retrospectively with the cumulative\neffect of initially applying the standard as an adjustment to the opening\nbalance of retained earnings, accordingly comparative financial\ninformation is not being restated.

There is no adjustment required to opening retained earnings as the timing or value of revenue recognised on\ncontracts with customers has not changed.\nOther amending accounting standards and interpretations\nOther relevant accounting standards and amendments and interpretations effective for the current reporting period include:\n––\nAASB 2016-5 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions; and\n––\nAASB Interpretation 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration.\nThese standards have introduced new disclosures for the Annual Financial Report but did not affect the Group’s accounting policies or any of the\namounts recognised in the financial statements.\nF8 NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS\nCertain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for 31 December 2018 reporting periods and\nhave not been early adopted by the Group. The Group’s assessment of the impact of these new standards and interpretations is set out below.\nReference\nand Title\nDetails of New Standard/Amendment/Interpretation\nApplication date\nfor the Group\nAASB 16\nLeases\nThe Group is required to adopt AASB 16 Leases from 1 January 2019. The Group has assessed the estimated\nimpact that initial application of AASB 16 will have on its consolidated financial statements, as described below.\nThe actual impacts of adopting the standard on 1 January 2019 may change because:\na)\t the Group has not finalised the testing and assessment of controls over its new IT systems; and\nb)\t \u0007the new accounting policies are subject to change until the Group presents its first financial statements that\ninclude the date of initial application.\nAASB 16 introduces a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees. A lessee recognises a\nright-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation\nto make lease payments. There are recognition exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low-value items.\nLessor accounting remains similar to the current standard – i.e. lessors continue to classify leases as finance or\noperating leases.\nAASB 16 replaces existing leases guidance, including AASB 117 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an\nArrangement contains a Lease, SIC-15 Operating Leases – Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance\nof Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease.\nThe Group plans to apply AASB 16 initially on 1 January 2019, using the modified retrospective approach.\nThe Group plans to apply the practical expedient to grandfather the definition of a lease on transition. This\nmeans that it will apply AASB 16 to all contracts entered into before 1 January 2019 and identified as leases\nin accordance with AASB 117 and IFRIC 4.\nImpact:\nLeases in which the Group is a lessee\nThe Group will recognise new assets and liabilities for its operating leases. The nature of expenses related to\nthose leases will now change because the Group will recognise a depreciation charge for right-of-use assets\nand interest expense on lease liabilities.\nPreviously, the Group recognised operating lease expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease,\nand recognised assets and liabilities only to the extent that there was a timing difference between actual lease\npayments and the expense recognised.\nNo significant impact is expected for the Group’s finance leases.\nBased on the information currently available, the Group estimates that it will recognise additional lease liabilities\nof $111 million and right-of-use assets of $92 million as at 1 January 2019. The Group does not expect\nthe adoption of AASB 16 to impact its ability to comply with the revised maximum leverage threshold loan\ncovenants described in Note D2.\nAlthough the Directors anticipate that the adoption of AASB 16 will impact the Group’s financial statements,\nit is impracticable at this stage to provide a reasonable estimate of such impact.\nLeases in which the Group is lessor\nThe Group will reassess the classification of sub-leases in which the Group is a lessor. Based on the information\ncurrently available, the Group expects that it will reclassify sub-leases as finance leases, resulting in recognition\nof a finance lease receivable of $19 million as at 1 January 2019.\n1 January 2019\nF – OTHER INFORMATION",

The ongoing\nlosses of Watagan are not recognised by the Group as it does\nnot have contractual agreements or a constructive obligation to\ncontribute to Watagan. A disclosure of the summarised financial\nposition and results of Watagan are included in the financial\nstatements in note E2(b)(i).\nAs at 31 December 2018 Watagan had total property, plant and\nequipment, and mining tenements of $1.184 billion. Disclosed in\nnote E2(b)(i) there is significant operational uncertainty due to\nDonaldson being on care and maintenance and Austar having\nongoing operational issues.\nThe Group as the operator of Watagan has performed an\nimpairment assessment as to the recoverability of these assets\nand has concluded that these assets are not impaired as at\n31 December 2018. In preparing the impairment assessment,\nmanagement has used a set of key assumptions which differ from\nthe assumptions used by the Group in performing impairment\nassessments for its other assets subject to impairment testing.\nThe impairment assessment is complex and involves significant\njudgment.\nWatagan’s financial position and performance are not\nconsolidated by the Group, however, disclosure is required\nto reflect the underlying financial position and financial\nperformance of Watagan in the notes to the financial statements.\nAs Watagan may be reconsolidated by the Group in the future, a\nmaterial impairment may be required at such time. As a result, it\nis considered to be a key audit matter.\nOur audit procedures included, among others:\n•\nReviewing and challenging the position papers\nprepared by management for the assessment\nof the carrying value of the underlying Watagan\nassets\n•\nEvaluating managements’ key valuation\nassumptions and estimates used in the\nimpairment testing. This includes, documenting\nthe skills and experience of the experts preparing\nthe valuation workings to consider whether we\ncan rely on the work they performed\n•\nPerforming sensitivity analysis on key inputs\n•\nReviewing the Group’s disclosures included in the\nfinancial statements for Watagan’s impairment\ntesting\n•\nEngaging our corporate finance specialists to\nreview the impairment model and various inputs.\nAcquisition of additional 28.9% of Warkworth Associates and disposal of 16.6% of HVO Joint Venture\n(Note E1)\nIn September 2017 the Group acquired Coal & Allied Industries\nLimited (Coal & Allied). The acquisition accounting was finalised\nduring 2018.\nIn completing the acquisition of Coal & Allied, the Group entered\ninto agreements to acquire a further 28.9% interest in the\nWarkworth Associates Joint Venture (Warkworth), and divesting\na 16.6% interest in HVO Joint Venture. These transactions were\ncompleted in 2018. The Warkworth acquisition consideration of\nUS$230 million has been allocated to the identifiable assets and\nliabilities of Warkworth. The divestment of HVO has recorded a\ngain on disposal of A$78 million.\nThere is a high level of judgement and estimation involved in\ncalculating the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired by\nthe Group. The disposal accounting has involved estimates and\njudgement to allocate the identifiable assets and liabilities of\nCoal & Allied to its business units. Given the extent of judgement\nrequired and significant estimates involved, we consider this a key\naudit matter.\nOur audit procedures included, among others:\n•\nAssessing the source and appropriateness of\nkey assumptions made in the purchase price\nallocation\n•\nIn assessing key assumptions we utilised our\nvaluation experts who assisted with assessing\nthe valuation methodology against accepted\nindustry practice, discount rates, cross checks of\nthe valuation, coal prices and forecast foreign\nexchange rates\n•\nComparing the accounting valuation with the\ntaxation valuation to check the deferred taxation\ncalculations to consider whether deferred\ntaxation balances were recognised appropriately\n•\nAgreeing the consideration paid to supporting\ndocumentation\n•\nAssessing the Group’s acquisition accounting\ndisclosures.\n181",

      "text_content": "INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT      ANNUAL REPORT 2018      175\nKey Audit Matter\nHow the matter was addressed during the audit\nImpairment of non-current assets\n(Note C3)\nA substantial portion of the value of the Group’s non-current\nassets are tangible and intangible assets which are subject to\nan impairment assessment and revaluations in accordance with\nAASB 136 Impairment of Assets or AASB 9 Financial Instruments.\nThese assets include property plant and equipment (note C1),\nmining tenements (note C2), intangible assets (note C5), royalty\nreceivable (note C9) and long-term receivables from joint\nventures (note C7).\nAsset valuation was a key audit matter due to the size of the\nbalances, being 72% of the Group’s non-current assets, and\nthe level of judgement required to be applied to prepare the\nimpairment assessment.\nOur audit procedures included, among others:\n•\nAssessing the determination of the Group’s Cash-\nGenerating Units\n•\nConsidering the assessment of impairment\nindicators which require an impairment test\n•\nEvaluating the forecast commodity prices\nincluding comparison to available market\ninformation\n•\nComparing estimated operating costs and capital\nexpenditure used in the impairment assessment\nwith the latest approved mine plans and budgets\n•\nComparing the life of mine plan used in\nimpairment with reserves and resources reported\nby internal geological experts. Evaluating the\ncompetency and objectivity of the experts by\nconsidering their professional qualifications and\nexperience\n•\nWorking with our valuation specialists to compare\nkey assumptions such as discount rates and\nforeign exchange rates to market information\n•\nPerforming sensitivity analysis on the key\nassumptions\n•\nAssessing the Group’s impairment disclosures.\nTaxation\n(Note B6)\nThe Group is subject to income taxes in Australia. Significant\njudgement is required in determining the provision for income\ntaxes and associated deferred taxation balances. The Group\nestimates its tax liabilities based on the Group’s interpretation of\ntaxation laws and regulations. Where the final outcome of these\nmatters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded\nsuch differences will impact the current and deferred tax assets\nand liabilities in the period in which such a determination is\nmade.\nThe Company must comply with the provisions of the Continuity\nof Ownership Test (COT) to continue to carry forward deferred\ntax assets of A$624 million that are associated with prior period\nlosses. With the acquisitions completed by the Group there is a\nhigh degree of complexity associated with the Allocable Cost\nAmount (ACA) calculations associated with these acquisitions.\nFurthermore, the Group is involved in a significant value\nand quantity of related party transactions which must be in\ncompliance with the transfer pricing provisions of international\ntaxation laws and regulations.\nSignificant judgement is required to calculate taxation balances,\nincluding assessing the recognition and measurement of taxation\nbalances where there is a range of possible outcomes due to\ndifferent interpretations of taxation law and regulations. Due to\nthe size of the deferred tax balances on a gross basis we consider\nthis to be a key audit matter.\nOur audit procedures included, among others:\n•\nEngaging the use of our taxation experts to assist\nwith:\n»\nThe ACA calculation\n»\nThe tax calculation\n»\nConsidering any uncertain taxation positions\n»\nAssessing transfer pricing arrangements\n»\nEvaluating the COT assessment\n•\nAssessing the Group’s taxation disclosures.\n182",

The other information comprises the information in the\nGroup’s fi nancial report for the year ended 31 December 2018, but does not include the fi nancial statements and our\nauditor’s report thereon.\nOur opinion on the fi nancial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of\nassurance conclusion thereon.\nIn connection with our audit of the fi nancial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and,\nin doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the fi nancial statements or our\nknowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information;\nwe are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\nResponsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Statements\nThe directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of fi nancial statements that give a true and fair\nview in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for such internal control\nas the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of fi nancial statements that give a true and fair\nview and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the fi nancial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as\na going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis\nof accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic\nalternative but to do so.\nThe directors are responsible for overseeing the Group’s fi nancial reporting process. In Note A(i), the directors also\nstate, in accordance with Accounting Standard AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements, that the fi nancial\nstatements comply with IFRS.\nAuditor’s responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the fi nancial statements based on our audit. Our objectives are to obtain\nreasonable assurance about whether the fi nancial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement,\nwhether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is\na high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing\nStandards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error\nand are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to infl uence the\neconomic decisions of users taken on the basis of these fi nancial statements.\nAs part of an audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgement and\nmaintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n•\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the fi nancial statements, whether due to fraud or error,\ndesign and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is suffi  cient and\nappropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from\nfraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,\nmisrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n•\nObtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are\nappropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the eff ectiveness of the\nGroup’s internal control. However, we will communicate to you in writing concerning any signifi cant defi ciencies\nin internal control relevant to the audit of the fi nancial statements that we have identifi ed during the audit.\n•\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and\nrelated disclosures made by management.\n183",

AUSTRALIA LTD\n# **OUR** **OUTLOOK**\n\n###### Yancoal will continue its drive towards increased production and cost efficiency. Expansion and extension projects across its tier-one assets combined with ongoing cost minimising efforts underpin future cash flow. Outside the existing assets, Yancoal remains open to strategic acquisitions.\n\n\n**ASSETS AND GROWTH**\n\n\n\nThrough 2018 Yancoal consolidated the high\nquality assets secured in late 2017 through the\nCoal & Allied transaction.\n\n\nYancoal anticipates demand for its high quality\nlow-sulphur coal to remain healthy through 2019.\nIn combination with a constrained market supply\nresponse for these products, this should result\nin premiums the Company can achieve through\nthe year.\n\n\nIn the year ahead, Yancoal will continue\nthe exploration, expansion and optimisation\nefforts across the three tier-one assets of\n\nMount Thorley Warkworth, Moolarben and\nHunter Valley Operations.\n\n\nKey projects include an underground mine\nconcept at Mount Thorley Warkworth.\nThe underground mine could add six million\ntonnes per annum of raw coal production.\nExploration drilling for the pre-feasibility\non the target seams concluded in late 2018.\n\n\nAt Moolarben, mine plan modifications could add\na further six million tonnes per annum of raw coal\nproduction to the production profile. It is through\noptimisation of the approved operations that this\nwould be achieved.\n\n\nAt the third tier-one asset, Hunter Valley\nOperations, Yancoal continues to work with\njoint venture partner Glencore Coal to implement\na strategic review of existing operational,\nmaintenance and fleet efficiencies. The focus\nis on delivering operational synergies identified\nduring the joint venture transaction. This project\ncontributes to the ongoing operating cost\ncontrol efforts.\n\n\n1 \u0007Operating cash costs exclude Government royalties.\n\n2019e is an estimate for the forward period.\n\n\n\nBlending of our coal products to meet evolving\nmarket conditions is an ongoing opportunity to\nmaximise the revenue potential of our asset base.\nThe aim is to combine coals of various qualities\nand characteristics to achieve a higher average\nrealised price.\n\n\n**GUIDANCE**\n\n\nOur focus is on the controllable operational factors\nthat drive the financial outcomes. In 2019 the\ncompany intends to increase its production while\nmaintaining steady operating costs.\n\n\nThe guidance for saleable coal production in 2019\nis approximately 35 million tonnes (attributable),\nup from 32.9 million tonnes in 2018. The majority\nof the output will come from the three tier-one\nassets, Mount Thorley Warkworth, Moolarben\nand Hunter Valley Operations (in 2018 it was\n90% of 32.9 million tonnes).\n\n\nYancoal will maintain strong cost discipline, with\n2019 cash costs (excluding Government royalties)\nexpected to remain flat at around A$62.5/t (2018:\nA$63/t) [1] . Yancoal continues to secure efficiency\ngains from the assets acquired in 2017; this enables\nthe flat operating cost forecast despite the broader\nindustry cost pressure.\n\n\nForecast capital expenditure for 2019 is around\nA$285 million (attributable); this is consistent\nwith prior three years, despite the increased\noperational production profile.\n\n\nANNUAL REPORT 2018 **7**\n\n\n**PRODUCTION BASE EXPANSION**\n\n\nSaleable Coal production (attributable share), Million tonnes\n\n\n35\n\n\n30\n\n\n25\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n10\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n2016 2017 2018 2019e\n\n\n**STABLE PRODUCTION COSTS**\n\n\nOperating Cash costs, A$/t FOB\n\n\n80\n\n\n70\n\n\n\n60\n\n\n50\n\n\n40\n\n\n30\n\n\n20\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n2016 2017 2018 2019e\n\n\n\n**CONTROLLED CAPITAL EXPENDITURE**\n\n\nCapital Expenditure (attributable), A$ million\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n\n\n350\n\n\n300\n\n\n250\n\n\n200\n\n\n150\n\n\n100\n\n\n50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2016 2017 2018 2019e\n\n\n**8** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\n\n\n\n**BAOCAI ZHANG**\n\nCHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD\n\n\n\n**ACHIEVEMENTS**\n\n2018 has been a year of extraordinary growth and\nsuccess. We have achieved a record financial result,\npaid half year and full year dividends, significantly\nreduced our debt and successfully listed Yancoal\nAustralia Ltd on the Main Board of the Stock\n\nExchange of Hong Kong.\n\n\nOur transformational financial turnaround\ndemonstrates the robustness of our operational,\ninvestment and cash flow management strategies.\n\n\n**EXCEPTIONAL RESULT**\nOur renewed financial strength has been achieved\nvia our consistently disciplined approach to cost\nmanagement and the implementation of production\nefficiencies.\n\n\nBenefitting from a full year’s attributable production\nand coal sales from our tier-one assets, Yancoal\nachieved a record profit after tax of A$852 million\nfrom revenue of A$4,850 million.\n\n\nOur total operating EBITDA was A$2,180 million,\nmore than double that of the prior year with a full\nyear’s contribution from Mount Thorley Warkworth\nand the Hunter Valley Operations complementing\nthe Moolarben complex. The margin achieved was\nalso stronger than the prior year.\n\n\nIn accordance with our assurance to return\n\nshareholder value following the strategic acquisition\nof Coal & Allied in September 2017, we have\nsignalled a new era of financial stability for Yancoal\nvia the payment of a maiden interim dividend\ntotalling A$130 million on 21 September 2018,\nand a final dividend totalling A$211 million and\nspecial dividend of A$166 million on 30 April 2019.\n\n\nOur total FY2018 dividend payments of A$507\nmillion represent a payout ratio of ~60%, consisting\nof 40% of net profit after tax (A$341 million) and a\n19.5% special dividend (A$166 million). Yancoal has\nsubsequently announced a targeted dividend payout\nof 50% of net profit after tax in the year ahead.\n\n\n###### In 2018 we have fortified our position in the competitive international coal market and returned the Yancoal Group to a position of strength and financial health.\n# **CHAIRMAN’S** **LETTER**\n\n\nANNUAL REPORT 2018 **9**\n\n\n\n**CASH FLOW MANAGEMENT**\n\nThe strength of the Company’s 2018 balance sheet\nand cash flow management strategy has enabled\nYancoal to pay down debt throughout 2018 and\nend the financial year with A$1,031 million in cash.\nThis cash has subsequently been used to facilitate\nthe Company’s final dividend payment and a further\ndebt repayment of US$500 million [1] .\n\n\nWe have now reduced the Company’s total debt\nliabilities by US$1.4 billion since completion of the\nacquisition of Coal & Allied on 1 September 2017.\n\n\nSuch an achievement demonstrates the quality\nof our assets, the aptitude of our operational\nleadership teams, the commitment of our Board\nto our shareholders, and the sustained strength\nof the thermal and metallurgical coal markets.\n\n\nRepayment of debt remains a critical objective\nof our long-term plan for strategic growth and we\nremain committed to further prepayments as revenue\nallows and in the best interests of all shareholders.\n\n\n**OPERATIONAL STRENGTH**\n\nWithin the past two years, Yancoal has successfully\nrestructured its business to significantly improve\noperational efficiencies and establish new blending\nand marketing opportunities.\n\n\nWe have implemented strict cost control measures\nat all sites and forged strong bonds with our many\ncustomers and joint venture partners to maximise the\nchanging scale of our operations, post acquisition.\n\n\nWith market demand for high quality thermal coal\nremaining strong throughout 2018, Yancoal produced\na record 50.0 million tonnes of saleable coal for\n\n2018, up 59% on the year prior.\n\n\nOur three tier-one assets led an increase in total\n\nattributable coal sales of 68% on the year prior, with\nYancoal achieving total sales of 37.1 million tonnes\nin 2018, up from 22.1 million tonnes in 2017.\n\n\nImportantly, we also delivered a consistently positive\nimprovement in safety, awareness and training across\nall operations, decreasing our Total Recordable Injury\nFrequency Rate from 10.43 in 2017 to 7.74 in 2018.\n\n\nWe cannot achieve our production and growth targets\nwithout considering and adopting safe operating\npractices in everything we do. We maintain our\nposition that we never compromise on safety.\n\n\n1 \u0007As announced 25 February 2019.\n\n\n\n**HK LISTING**\n\nIn 2018 we strengthened our shareholder base\nvia Yancoal’s successful listing on the Main Board\nof The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Ltd.\n\n\nAs an established leader within the global resources\nsector, our Hong Kong listing is an important step\nforward in the Company’s history. Yancoal is now\nthe only dual-listed Australian/Hong Kong coal\noperator and our listing will provide further\nopportunities to drive share price improvement\nand improve Yancoal’s liquidity.\n\n\nYancoal also raised A$268 million as part of the\nGlobal Offering associated with the Company’s\nHK listing, with the net proceeds raised to be\nused to repay debt and unsecured loans; finance\npotential acquisitions; and for working capital and\ngeneral corporate purposes. Proceeds raised were\nalso used to finance the acquisition of an additional\n4% interest in Moolarben in December 2018.\n\n\n**OUTLOOK**\n\nIn the year ahead, Yancoal Australia remains focused\non delivering high quality thermal and metallurgical\ncoal to meet increasing global demand; and\ndeveloping its pipeline of major projects.\n\n\nWe have high expectations for our future growth,\nand remain committed to leading by example\nand operating in accordance with the values\nof the Yancoal Way, guided by our core beliefs\nof compliance, transparency and efficiency.\n\n\nAs we continue to support the development\nof a low-emissions future, coal remains a critical\npart of global baseload energy supply needs.\nIt is therefore our responsibility to operate efficiently\nand transparently to ensure only the highest grades\nof quality coal are being produced and exported\nto meet future low-emission, high-energy needs\nin the international market.\n\n\nDemand for both thermal and metallurgical coal\nis expected to continue to grow in 2019, and\nI believe this year’s financial and operational results\nclearly demonstrate we have the resilience, skills\nand strength to maximise future opportunities.\n\n\nTogether, with the support of our majority\nshareholders, the Board and Executive, and\noperational leadership teams, I believe we will\ngenerate further success for Yancoal Australia\nand value for investors.\n\n\n2019 will be a year of new opportunities and I look\nforward to the road ahead as an integral participant\nin our key markets.\n\n\n**10** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\n# **OUR STRATEGY**\n\n###### The expanded production base and strengthened financial position are milestones on an ongoing journey. Through its core values and strategic advantages, Yancoal strives for improved shareholder returns. The Board and management team continually seek improved operational performance, the certainty of product quality and healthy relationships inside and outside the business.\n\n\n\n**STRATEGIC ADVANTAGES**\n\n\n1. People – Attracting, retaining and developing\n\npeople with the right skills is essential.\nOur assets only deliver if our teams are\nworking together. Yancoal has assembled\na highly capable team.\n\n\n2. Projects – Yancoal assembled a strong asset\n\nportfolio through opportune acquisitions of\ntier-one assets with robust operating margins\nthat underpin the business.\n\n\n3. Relationships – As the largest pure-play coal\n\ncompany in Australia, Yancoal supplies\nnumerous customers. There is a continued\n\nemphasis on strong relationships with Japan,\nSouth Korea, China and Taiwan.\n\n\n4. Products – Yancoal produces high quality\n\ncoal for the international market. Maximising\nthe achieved price through product blending\nto meet the evolving customer demand\nis a continual focus.\n\n\n5. Optimisation – The recently expanded\n\nasset portfolio continues to deliver cost\nefficiencies. Optimising operations,\nmaintenance, procurement, product blending\nand taxes are all contributing to competitive\nfinancial performance.\n\n\n\n**CORE BELIEFS**\nBusiness Transparency, Compliance and Efficiency\n\n\n\nYancoal asks its sites and corporate functions\nto operate to the highest governance standards\n– applying transparent, compliant and efficient\nprocesses to meet the needs of all stakeholders.\n\n\n**CORE VALUES**\n\nPeople, Safety, Integrity, Excellence, Innovation\n\n\n**High way**\nExcellence\n\n\n\n\n\n**Better way**\nInnovation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Right way**\nIntegrity\n\n\nThe Yancoal Core Values underpin the\n“Core Beliefs”. The values start with engaged\npeople; working safely; acting with integrity;\nstriving for excellence; and seeking improvement\nthrough innovation.\n\n\n**CAPITAL ALLOCATION**\n\n\nThe cash from operations surged to $1.75 billion\nin 2018, a four-fold increase over 2017. The\nincreased production base, strong commodity\npricing and stable operating costs all contributed\nto this compelling outcome. The robust cash flow\nenables Yancoal to pursue several initiatives\nconcurrently.\n\n\nThe first stage in the capital allocation cycle\nis to concurrently meet the primary obligations.\n\n\n**REINVESTMENT**\n**– PRIMARY OBLIGATION #1**\nFuture operating cash flow depends upon the\nassets delivering the availability and utilisation\ntargets. Reinvesting in the operations and\nequipment is essential to this. The forecast capital\nand sustaining expenditure in 2019 is $285 million;\nthis is less than the prior three-year average as the\nequipment upgrade cycle and expansion project\nrequired higher levels of capital in previous years\nbut has reduced the near-term burden.\n\n\n**DIVIDEND RETURNS**\n**– PRIMARY OBLIGATION #2**\n\nThe Board provides shareholders with direct\nexposure to the Company’s performance via an\nNet Profit After Tax (NPAT) based distribution.\nIn 2018 the total Dividend allocation was $507\nmillion; including the special dividend this was\na payout ratio of ~60% from Net Profit After Tax.\nThe 2019 target is a 50% NPAT payout ratio [1] .\n\n\nThe next stage of the capital cycle is consideration\nof the discretionary opportunities. The Board\nseeks to balance the relative merits of each\n\nagainst the other.\n\n**\u0007**\n\n\n\n**\u0007**\n\n\n\nANNUAL REPORT 2018 **11**\n\n\n**DEBT REDUCTION**\n**– DISCRETIONARY PURSUIT #1**\n\nThe rapid reduction of debt is something the\nCompany continues to deliver. US$1.4 billion\nin debt has been repaid ahead of schedule since\nthe Coal & Allied transaction in late 2017. The debt\n\nrepayment brought the gearing ratio down to 35%\nat the end of December [2], and the Leverage Ratio\ndown to 1.4x [3] . Yancoal intends to continue making\nearly repayments to reduce its debt position and\noptimise existing loan facilities; particularly in the\ncoming year given the coal price outlook.\n\n\n**GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES**\n**– DISCRETIONARY PURSUIT #2**\nYancoal has identified 12 million tonnes of\nadditional annual production to pursue within its\nexisting asset base. The internal expansion provides\na pathway for boosting operating cash flow.\nThe Coal & Allied transaction demonstrated that\n\nexternal growth could also be tremendously\nsuccessful – it transformed the Company in 2018.\nExamining opportunities for corporate acquisitions\nis an ongoing effort, but growth must be accretive.\n\n\nIn the Capital Allocation Cycle, Asset Reinvestment\nand Growth Opportunities support the future\ncycles, Dividends reward the investors, and Debt\nReduction improves the capacity for all other steps.\n\n\n**\u0007**\n\n\n\n**YANCOAL CAPITAL ALLOCATION CYCLE – PRIORITISES CAPITAL RETURNS**\n**AND ASSET REINVESTMENT**\n\n\n**\u0007**\n\n\n\n**\u0007**\n\n\n\n**\u0007**\n\n\n\n**\u0007**\n\n\n\n**\u0007**\n\n\n\n**\u0007**\n\n\n\n1 \u0007The NPAT used will be adjusted for foreign exchange, hedge reserve\n\nmovements and non-operating items as determined by the Directors.\n2 \u0007Gearing calculated as Net Debt divided by the sum of Net Debt and Equity.\n3 **\u0007** Leverage Ratio calculated as Net Debt divided by Operating EBITDA.\n\nNet Debt does not include the debt associated with Watagan.\n\n\n**12** **YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD**\n\n\n\n**REINHOLD SCHMIDT**\n\nCEO YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\n\n\n\nThe Yancoal team has implemented our\noperational and corporate strategies to deliver the\nrobust financial rebound we promised shareholders\nduring our acquisition of Coal & Allied.\n\n\nSupported by our leadership team, the Board and\nour majority shareholders, we have set a new\nstandard of success for our business and\ndefined Yancoal as consistently exceeding\nmarket expectations.\n\n\n**SAFETY**\nIn a year of continued growth and financial\nachievement, I am encouraged by the significant\nimprovement in our safety performance.\n\n\nYancoal’s operations reported a Total Recordable\nInjury Frequency Rate (“TRIFR”) of 7.74 for 2018,\ndown from 10.43 in the year prior.

A 68% uplift in the sales volume and a 16% increase in the average sale price drove the strong revenue performance.\n\n\n\n**INCOME STATEMENT**\n**ELEMENTS**\n\n\n**REVENUE AND COSTS**\n\nTotal Revenue increased by 80% from $2,716\nmillion in 2017 to $4,891 million in 2018. A 74%\nuplift in the sales volume and a 16% increase\nin the average sale price drove the strong\nrevenue performance.\n\n\nThe Operating Cash Costs increased by less than\n2% to $63/t. Including royalties and the non-cash\ndepreciation and amortisation charges, the Total\nProduction Costs increased by less than 5% to\n$89/t. These costs compare to an average sale\nprice of $132/t across all the coal sold.\n\n\n**OPERATING EBITDA AND OPERATING**\n**EBITDA MARGIN**\n\nOperating EBITDA increased by 121% from\n$988 million in 2017 to $2,180 million in 2018.\nThe EBITDA flows directly from the higher\nrevenue with a modest offset from the cash\ncosts (A$73/t including royalties). Consequently,\nOperating EBITDA margin as a percentage of\nOperating Revenue increased from 36% in 2017\nto 45% in 2018.\n\n\n\n**DEPRECIATION AND AMORTISATION**\n\nDepreciation and amortisation expenses increased\nby 104% from $256 million in 2017 to $523 million\nin 2018. The increase primarily stemmed from the\nincreased asset base following the Coal & Allied\nacquisition. On a per tonne basis, the depreciation\nand amortisation costs increased from $14/t to\n$16/t in 2018.\n\n\n**NET FINANCE COSTS**\nNet finance costs decreased by 4% from $282\nmillion in 2017 to $270 million in 2018, primarily\ndue to the ongoing voluntary loan repayments.\n\n\n**INCOME TAX EXPENSE**\n\nIt is important to note that the Company did\nnot pay any cash tax in 2018; this is due to tax\nlosses carried forward from prior years. There\nare further tax losses to be utilised in future years.\nFor accounting purposes, the Income tax expense\nwas $320 million in 2018, and the effective tax rate\n\nwas 27.3%.\n\n\n**NET PROFIT AFTER TAX**\nThese elements combined to deliver a profit after\nincome tax that increased 272% from $229 million\nin 2017 to $852 million in 2018.\n\n\n**CASH FLOW ELEMENTS**\nNet operating cash inflows increased 328% to\n$1,747 million mainly reflecting the higher EBITDA.\n\n\nNet investing cash outflows were $55 million; asset\ndisposals and loan repayments offset capital\nexpenditure and JV stake acquisitions.\n\n\nNet financing cash outflows were $904 million;\nmostly due to the $1,014 million of voluntary net\ndebt repayments and the $130 million interim\ndividend. The $268 million raised in the Hong Kong\nIPO was a positive inflow.\n\n\nThe overall outcome was a $824 million increase in\nthe net cash position to $1,031 million.

Ltd, BOCI Financial Products Limited and United NSW\n\nEnergy Limited. Under the arrangement, Yancoal’s interests in the assets of Ashton, Austar and Donaldson were transferred to and held by Watagan.\n\n\n(5) Coal Reserves have been depleted from the previous reporting period due to ongoing studies and investigations in the Stage 3 area during 2018. Austar was subject to\n\n\nprohibition notices issued by the Resource Regulator that restricted current operations in Bellbird South and investigations by the Resource Regulator are continuing.\n\nOngoing work is being undertaken by Watagan in respect of the very challenging geological and geotechnical conditions at the Austar mine, including both the Bellbird\nSouth and Stage 3 areas that may have a significant adverse impact on future commercial operations. The future prospects of the Austar mine are therefore uncertain, and\n\nwill depend upon the work currently being conducted by Watagan and its internal and external advisers. If it is determined that the mine is unable to return to previously\n\nforecast levels of production, there may be a need to proceed to a permanent shutdown.

class assets\nconsisting of both large-scale open cut and underground mines\ncomprising five coal mine complexes in Australia.\n\n\nAs a leading low-cost coal producer in the global seaborne market,\nYancoal’s coal mining operations produce a mix of premium thermal,\nsemi-soft coking, and pulverised coal injection (PCI) coals, together\nwith mid-to high-ash thermal coals.\n\nThe Group’s financial results are largely dependent on the demand\nfor thermal and metallurgical coal, which in turn depends on\nmacroeconomic trends, including regional and global economic activity,\nand the price and availability of alternative forms of energy production.\n\nOur customers are located throughout the Asia-Pacific region with\nJapan, Singapore, China, South Korea and Taiwan accounting for\napproximately 81% of our revenue from coal sales in the year ended\n31 December 2018.\n\n\nThermal coal is primarily used in electricity generation and its end\nusers are typically power and utilities companies. Metallurgical coal is\nprimarily used to produce coke for blast furnace steel production and\nits end users are typically steel plants. We also sell coal to customers\nin the commodities trading business, who purchase the Group’s coal\nfor trading purposes or to on-sell to their end customers. Commodity\ntraders are similarly exposed to regional and global demand trends in\nthe coal market.\n\n\nThe Group’s export thermal coal is generally priced on either an index\nprice, an annual fixed price or on a spot price basis. Generally, lower\nash products are priced relative to the GlobalCOAL Newcastle index\nand higher ash products are priced relative to the Argus/McCloskey\nAPI5 index. Annual fixed price contracts are mostly priced against the\nJapanese Power Utility (JPU) reference price, which is the contract price\nagreed between major Australian suppliers and Japanese power utilities.\nThe balance of our sales are priced on a fixed spot price negotiated at\nthe time of settlement that also reflects the terms of the arrangement.\n\n\n\nThe Group’s export metallurgical coal is either priced on a benchmark\nor spot price basis. Most term contracts are priced against a\nbenchmark pricing mechanism which is negotiated on a quarterly\nbasis between major Australian suppliers and Japanese steel mills.\nSpot sales are priced relative to the market at the time and are\nmostly done on a fixed price basis. The large majority of the Group’s\nsemi-soft coking coal out of Newcastle and low volatile PCI out of\nQueensland is priced relative to the quarterly benchmark.\n\n\nThe Group’s coal sales revenue is typically recognised on a Free on\nBoard (FOB) basis when coal is loaded at the load port in Australia.\n\n\nThe Group’s overall average selling price of coal increased by 16%\nfrom A$114 per tonne in 2017 to A$132 per tonne in 2018, mainly as\na result of the increase in global coal market prices during this period,\nincluding low-ash thermal coal prices increasing by approximately\nUS$19 per tonne and semi-soft metallurgical coal prices increasing\nby approximately US$15 per tonne. The Group’s average selling price\nof thermal coal increased from A$102 per tonne to A$123 per tonne,\nwhile the average selling price of metallurgical coal increased from\nA$165 per tonne to A$182 per tonne.\n\n\nThe Group’s overall average cash operating costs excluding\ngovernment royalties increased from A$62 per tonne in 2017 to\nA$63 per tonne in 2018 primarily due to an increase in raw materials\nand consumables used due to an increase in diesel costs of 123%,\nprimarily due to increased market prices for diesel fuel and larger\ntruck fleets at the acquired Coal & Allied Industries Limited (C&A)\nmines. The Group’s overall cash operating costs including government\nroyalties increased from A$71 per tonne in 2017 to A$73 per tonne\nin 2018 with the increase in royalties driven by higher coal prices.\n\n\nThe table below sets out the Run of Mine (ROM) and saleable\nproduction for each Yancoal owned mine on a 100% basis during\nthe Group’s period of ownership.\n\n\n**Year ended 31 December**\n\n\n\n**Ownership**\n\n**%** **[(1)]**\n\n\n\n**2018** **2017** **Change**\n\n**Mt** **Mt** **[(2)]** **%**\n\n\n\n**2017**\n\n\n\n**Change**\n\n\n\n**Mt**\n\n\n\n**Mt** **[(2)]**\n\n\n\n**ROM production**\n\nMoolarben 85% 18.6 14.7 27%\n\nMTW 82.9% 17.6 5.8 203%\n\nHVO 51% 19.0 6.2 206%\n\nStratford Duralie 100% 0.7 0.9 (22%)\n\nYarrabee 100% 3.4 3.4 –\n\nMiddlemount ~50% 4.8 5.3 (9%)\nWatagan 100% 2.4 4.8 (50%)\n\n**Total – 100% basis** **66.5** **41.1** **62%**\n\n\n**Saleable production**\n\nMoolarben 85% 16.5 12.4 33%\n\nMTW 82.9% 12.1 3.9 210%\n\nHVO 51% 13.3 4.8 177%\n\nStratford Duralie 100% 0.5 0.7 (29%)\n\nYarrabee 100% 2.6 2.8 (7%)\n\nMiddlemount ~50% 3.8 3.9 (3%)\nWatagan 100% 1.2 3.0 (60%)\n\n**Total – 100% basis** **50.0** **31.5** **59%**\n\n\n(1) Ownership percentage stated as at 31 December 2018.\n\n\n(2) 2017 only includes four months of production for the unincorporated MTW and HVO joint ventures from 1 September 2017.\n\n\n**MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS** ANNUAL REPORT 2018 **41**\n\n\nROM coal production was up 62% from 41.1Mt in 2017 to 66.5Mt in 2018.

The Group’s average selling price of\nthermal coal increased from A$102 per tonne to A$123 per tonne, while its average selling price of metallurgical coal increased from A$165\nper tonne to A$182 per tonne. Ex-mine thermal sales represented 85% of total ex-mine sales volume in 2018; an increase from 80% in 2017.\n\n\nThere was an increase in our ex-mine sales volume of coal of 74% from 19.3Mt in 2017 to 33.5Mt in 2018, mainly due to (a) the full year effect\nof the C&A Acquisition from 1 September 2017; (b) the Other acquisitions and disposals completed during 2018; and (c) the expansion of\nMoolarben from 10.2Mt in 2017 to 13.5Mt (equity) in 2018.\n\n\n\n**Year ended 31 December**\n\n**2018** **2017**\n\n**Amount** **% of revenue** **Amount**\n\n\n\n**% of revenue**\n\n\n**%**\n\n\n\n**% of revenue**\n\n\n\n**Amount**\n\n\n\n**$’m**\n\n\n\n**%**\n\n\n\n**$’m**\n\n\n\nJapan 1,055 22% 489 19%\nSingapore 861 18% 337 13%\n\nChina 739 16% 654 25%\n\nSouth Korea 664 14% 415 16%\n\nTaiwan 518 11% 131 5%\n\nThailand [(1)] 343 7% 85 3%\n\nAustralia [(1)] 295 6% 237 9%\n\nOthers [(2)] 265 6% 275 10%\n\n**Total revenue from external customers** **4,740** **100%** **2,623** **100%**\n\n\n(1) 2017 includes the reclassification of $85 million of revenue on the BLCP contract from Australia to Thailand.\n\n\n(2) Others includes Malaysia, Germany, Vietnam, India and Switzerland.\n\n\nThe Group achieved an increase in revenue from external customers across each of its key geographic markets. In particular, substantial\nincreases in revenue from 2017 to 2018 from (i) $489 million to $1,055 million in Japan, (ii) $337 million to $861 million in Singapore,\n(iii) $415 million to $664 million in South Korea and (iv) $131 million to $518 million in Taiwan. The increases in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan\nwere primarily attributable to the C&A Acquisition, with the quality of coal from the HVO and MTW mines being suitable for these typically higher\npriced markets.\n\n\nThe increase in the PRC was primarily due to efforts to increase sales of the Group’s higher-ash products to end users in the PRC.\n\n\nThe increase in Thailand was attributable to the full year effect of a long-term supply contract acquired as part of the C&A Acquisition.\n\n\n**Other income**\n\n\n\n**MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS** ANNUAL REPORT 2018 **45**\n\n\n**Year ended 31 December**\n\n\n\n**2018** **2017** **Change**\n\n**$M** **$M** **%**\n\n\n\n**2017**\n\n\n\n**Change**\n\n\n\n**$M** **$M** **%**\n\n\nNet gain on foreign exchange 61 – –\nSundry income 7 4 75%\n\n**Other income** **68** **4** **1,600%**\n\n\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\nOther income increased from $4 million in 2017 to $68 million in 2018, primarily due to a net gain on foreign exchange of $61 million (2017:\nnet loss of $8 million included in Other operating expenses) primarily due to exchange gains recognised on holding US$ cash balances as the\nAustralian dollar weakened during the year.\n\n**Changes in inventories of finished goods and work in progress**\nChanges in inventories of finished goods and work in progress decreased from $31 million in 2017 to $7 million in 2018.\n\n\n**PRODUCTION COSTS**\n\n\nAll-in total production costs, which include cash and non-cash operating costs, represent costs directly attributable to the production,\ntransportation and selling of coal as well as indirect corporate costs (in particular, corporate employee costs), but excluding transaction costs.\nCash operating costs comprise the cost of raw materials and consumables used, employee benefits, transportation contractual services and\nplant hire.

In addition, diesel costs increased\nby 123%, primarily due to increased market prices for diesel fuel and larger truck fleets at the acquired C&A mines. This contributed to an\nincrease in per ex-mine sales tonne raw materials and consumables used from $18 to $20 over the same period.\n\n\n**Employee benefits**\nEmployee benefits expenses increased by 72% from $302 million in 2017 to $518 million in 2018, primarily due to the increase in overall\nheadcount as a result of the C&A Acquisition and the Moolarben expansion. Per ex-mine sales tonne employee benefits expenses remained\nflat at $16 over the same period.\n\n\n**Transportation**\nTransportation costs increased by 72% from $312 million in 2017 to $537 million in 2018, primarily due to increased sales volume of\ncoal requiring additional payments for rail and freight services. Per ex-mine sales tonne transportation costs remained flat at $16 over the\nsame period.\n\n\n**Contractual services and plant hire**\nContractual services and plant hire expenses increased by 61% from $241 million in 2017 to $389 million in 2018, primarily due to the C&A\nAcquisition, although the level of contractors has been reduced during the year at these sites. This contributed to a decrease in per ex-mine\nsales tonne contractual services and plant hire from $12 to $11 over the same period.\n\n\n**46** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\n\n\n**MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS** (CONTINUED)\n\n\n\n**PRODUCTION COSTS (CONTINUED)**\n\n\n**Government royalties**\nGovernment royalties expenses increased by 101% from $173 million\nin 2017 to $347 million in 2018, primarily due to increased royalties\nlevied on our increased sales revenue, which were driven by both\nhigher prices and sales volumes. Royalties are determined on an\nad valorem basis by reference to the value of coal sold, the type of\nmine and the State the mine is located in and are payable to the\nappropriate State Government. This contributed to an increase in\nper ex-mine sales tonne government royalties from $9 to $10 over\nthe same period.\n\n\n**Coal purchases**\nCoal purchases decreased by 2% from $340 million in 2017 to\n$332 million in 2018. Coal purchases as a percentage of operating\nrevenue decreased from 13% to 7% over the same period, primarily\ndue to a relatively lower amount of coal blending being undertaken\non the C&A sales while we continue to evaluate and adjust to C&A’s\ncustomer relationships and their coal quality needs.\n\n\n**Other operating expenses**\nOther operating expenses increased by 37% from $54 million in 2017\nto $74 million in 2018, primarily as a result of the C&A Acquisition\nand Moolarben expansion.\n\n\n**Share of profit of equity-accounted investees, net of tax**\nShare of profit of equity-accounted investees, net of tax increased\nby 75% from $32 million in 2017 to $56 million in 2018 primarily\ndue to the improved profit after tax performance of the incorporated\nMiddlemount joint venture. The Group’s equity-accounted investment\nin Watagan is held on the balance sheet at nil value such that the loss\nafter tax of the Watagan Group of $217 million for the year ended\n31 December 2018 is not reflected in the Group’s Statement of profit\nand loss for the same period.\n\n\n**Operating EBITDA and operating EBITDA margin**\nOperating EBITDA increased by 121% from $988 million in 2017\nto $2,180 million in 2018 primarily due to an 80% increase in\noperating revenue partially offset by an increase in cash operating\ncosts (including royalties) from $71 to $73 per tonne over the same\nperiod. Operating EBITDA margin as a percentage of operating\nrevenue increased from 36% in 2017 to 45% in 2018.\n\n\n**Depreciation and amortisation**\nDepreciation and amortisation expenses increased by 104%\nfrom $256 million in 2017 to $523 million in 2018, primarily due\nto an increase in mining tenements and plant and equipment of\n$2,456 million and $1,326 million, respectively, from the C&A\nAcquisition, together with expansionary capital incurred at Moolarben.\nPer ex-mine sales tonne depreciation and amortisation costs\nincreased from $14 to $16 over the same period.\n\n\n\n**Operating EBIT and operating EBIT margin**\nOperating EBIT increased by 126% from $732 million in 2017 to\n$1,657 million in 2018 primarily due to an 80% increase in operating\nrevenue partially offset by an increase in cash operating costs\n(including royalties) from $71 to $73 per tonne and an increase in\ndepreciation and amortisation from $14 to $16 per tonne over the\nsame period. Operating EBIT margin as a percentage of operating\nrevenue increased from 27% in 2017 to 34% in 2018.\n\n\n**Net finance costs**\nNet finance costs decreased by 4% from $282 million in 2017\nto $270 million in 2018, primarily due to (i) an overall reduction in\ninterest-bearing liabilities during 2018 compared to 2017 following\nseveral voluntary loan repayments and (ii) a reduction in the Yanzhou\nguarantee fee provided on the Group’s syndicated facility being\npartially offset by (i) an increase in LIBOR during the year from\nan average of 1.17% in 2017 to an average of 2.43% in 2018\nand (ii) a decrease in the A$:US$ exchange rate resulting in an\nincrease in the Australian dollar finance charge. Net finance costs\nas a percentage of operating revenue decreased from 9% to 6%\nover the same period, primarily due to the C&A Acquisition being\nequity‑funded, which reduced the Group’s overall gearing levels.\n\n\n**Profit before income tax and profit before income tax margin**\nAs a result of the aforementioned reasons, profit before income tax\nincreased by 277% from $311 million in 2017 to $1,172 million in\n2018. Profit before income tax margin as a percentage of operating\nrevenue increased from 11% to 24% over the same period.\n\n\n**Income tax expense**\nIncome tax expense increased by 290% from $82 million in 2017\nto $320 million in 2018. The effective tax rate was 26.4% and 27.3%\nin the same years, respectively, which is lower than the Australian\ncorporate income tax rate of 30%. In 2018 the lower effective tax rate\nprimarily resulted from certain non-assessable income items including\nthe Group’s share of equity-accounted profits and part of the gain\non the partial disposal of HVO and an over provision in the prior\nyear. In 2017 the lower effective tax rate also primarily resulted from\ncertain non-assessable income items including the Group’s share of\nequity‑accounted profits and the gain on the C&A Acquisition partially\noffset by non-deductible stamp duty incurred on the C&A Acquisition.\n\n\n**Profit after income tax and profit after income tax margin**\nAs a result of the aforementioned reasons, profit after income tax\nincreased by 272% from $229 million in 2017 to $852 million in 2018.\nProfit after income tax margin as a percentage of operating revenue\nincreased from 8% to 17% over the same period.\n\n\n**MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS** ANNUAL REPORT 2018 **47**\n\n\n**OVERVIEW OF NON-OPERATING ITEMS**\n\n\nNon-operating items in the year ended 31 December 2018 and 2017 included the following:\n\n\n**Year ended 31 December**\n\n\n\n**2018**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**2017**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\nGain on disposal of interest in joint venture 78 –\nFair value losses recycled from hedge reserve (160) (229)\nStamp duty expensed (25) (167)\n\nTransaction costs (29) (33)\n\n–\nRe-measurement of contingent royalty (33)\n\n–\nRe-measurement of financial assets (29)\n\n–\nImpairment of financial assets (21)\n\nRe-measurement of royalty receivable 4 8\n\nGain on acquisition of subsidiaries – 177\n\nImpairment reversal on mining tenements – 100\n\nReceipts from joint venture participants – 5\n**Non-operating items** **(215)** **(139)**\n\n\nGain on disposal of interest in joint venture of $78 million is a one-off gain recognised on the disposal of a 16.6% interest in the HVO joint venture\nto Glencore whereby it was determined that the fair value of the consideration received and receivable exceeded the book value of the assets\nand liabilities being de-recognised.\n\nFair value losses recycled from the hedge reserve of $160 million (2017: $229 million) represent retranslation losses on the Group’s US dollardenominated loans which are attributable to changes in US$:A$ foreign exchange rates. Under the Group’s natural hedge policy, such losses are\nrecycled to the Statement of profit and loss based on the scheduled loan maturity dates. The amount of any fair value loss or gain recycled from\nthe hedge reserve in a period is a function of the amount of the hedged US dollar loan scheduled to mature in that period and the respective\nUS$:A$ exchange rates at the time the hedge was put in place and at the time the loan matured.\n\nStamp duty of $25 million was recognised on the acquisitions of the further 28.9% interest in the Warkworth joint venture, and the further 4%\ninterest in the Moolarben joint venture together with the final-true up on the C&A Acquisition.

Export\ncoal sales are denominated in US dollars and a strengthening of\nthe Australian dollar against the US dollar has an adverse impact\non earnings and cash flow settlement. Liabilities for some plant and\nequipment purchases and loans are denominated in currencies other\nthan the Australian dollar and a weakening of the Australian dollar\nagainst other currencies has an adverse impact on earnings and cash\nflow settlement.\n\nSee Note D9(a)(i) to the financial statements in this report for further\ndetails on foreign currency exposure and a sensitivity analysis of the\nimpact of hypothetical increases and decreases in the Australian dollar\nagainst relevant foreign currencies.\n\n\n**Price Risk**\n\nThe price risk of the Group includes coal price risk.\n\n\nThe Group does not enter into commodity contracts other than to\nmeet the Group’s expected usage and sales requirements; and such\ncontracts are not settled net. The royalty receivable from Middlemount\nis exposed to fluctuations in coal price. The Group currently does not\nhave any derivative hedges in place against the movement in the spot\ncoal price.\n\nSee Note D9(d)(iii) to the financial statements in this report for the\nroyalty receivable coal price sensitivity analysis.\n\n\nCoal sales are predominately provisionally priced initially. Provisionally\npriced sales are those for which price finalisation, referenced to\nthe relevant index, is outstanding at the reporting date. Provisional\npricing mechanisms embedded within these sales arrangements\nhave the character of a commodity derivative and are carried at fair\nvalue through profit and loss as part of trade receivables. The final\nsales price is determined normally seven to 90 days after delivery\nto the customer. At 31 December 2018, there were $234 million\nof provisionally priced sales. If prices were to increase by 10%\nprovisionally priced sales would increase by $23 million.\n\n\n**Interest Rate Risk**\n\nThe Group is subject to interest rate risk that arises from borrowings\nand cash and cash equivalents. Generally, no variable interest is\nreceivable or payable on the Group’s trade and other receivables or\npayables where applicable as they are fixed in nature and, therefore,\nthey are not exposed to the interest rate risk.\n\nThe Group’s cash flow interest rate risk for assets primarily arises\nfrom cash at bank and deposits subject to market bank rates. Floating\nrate borrowings bearing LIBOR rates are re-set on a quarterly basis.\n\nSee Note D9(a)(iii) to the financial statements in this report for a\nsensitivity analysis of the impact of hypothetical increases and\ndecreases in interest rates.\n\n\n**Credit Risk**\n\nCredit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on\nits contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.\nAs at 31 December 2018 the Group’s maximum exposure to credit\nrisk which will cause a financial loss to the Group due to failure to\ndischarge an obligation by the counterparties and financial guarantees\nprovided by the Group arises from the carrying amount of the\nrespective recognised financial assets as stated in the Consolidated\nbalance sheet and the amount of contingent liabilities in relation to\nfinancial guarantees issued by the Group.\n\n\nIn order to minimise credit risk, management has delegated a team\nresponsible for determination of credit limits, credit approvals and\nother monitoring procedures to ensure that follow-up action is\ntaken to recover overdue debts. In addition, the Group reviews the\nrecoverable amount of each individual trade debt at the end of the\nreporting period to ensure that adequate impairment losses are made\nfor irrecoverable amounts. In this regard, the Directors consider that\nthe Group’s credit risk is significantly reduced. The Group maintains\nits cash and cash equivalents with reputable banks. Therefore, the\nDirectors consider that the credit risk for such amounts is minimal.\n\nSee Note D9(b) to the financial statements in this report for further\ndetails on the Group’s credit risk exposure.\n\n\n\n**MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS** ANNUAL REPORT 2018 **51**\n\n\n**Liquidity Risk**\nLiquidity risk includes the risk that the Group will not be able to meet\nits financial obligations as they fall due. The Group will be impacted in\nthe following ways:\n\n(i) \u0007will not have sufficient funds to settle transactions on the\n\ndue date;\n\n(ii) \u0007will be forced to sell financial assets at a value which is less than\n\nwhat they are worth; or\n\n(iii) \u0007may be unable to settle or recover a financial asset at all.\n\n\nLiquidity risk is managed by maintaining sufficient cash and liquid\ndeposit balances and having readily accessible standby facilities in\nplace in accordance with the Board’s risk management policy.\n\nSee Note D9(c) to the financial statements in this report for further\ndetails on the remaining contractual maturity for the Group’s\nfinancial liabilities.\n\n\n**CONTINGENT LIABILITIES**\n\n\nThe contingent liabilities of the Group as at 31 December 2018\ncomprise (i) $875 million of bank guarantees comprising $471 million\nof performance guarantees provided to third parties and $404 million\nof guarantees provided in respect of the cost of restoration of certain\nmining leases given to government departments as required by\nstatute with respect to the Group’s owned and managed mines;\n(ii) a letter of support provided to the Middlemount Coal Pty Limited\njoint venture; and (iii) a number of claims that have been made against\nthe Group, including in respect of personal injuries, and in relation to\ncontracts which Group members are party to as part of the Group’s\nday to day operations.\n\nSee Note D8 to the financial statements in this report for further details\non the Group’s contingent liabilities.\n\n\n**CHARGES ON ASSETS**\n\n\nThe Group has a Syndicated Bank Guarantee Facility provided by\na syndicate of seven Australian and International banks totalling\nA$1 billion. As at 31 December 2018 the facility was drawn to\nA$808 million.\n\nDuring 2018 five of the seven banks also provided a Syndicated Term\nLoan facility of US$300 million which was fully drawn during the year.\n\n\nThe Syndicated Bank Guarantee and Term Loan facilities are\nboth secured by the assets of the consolidated group of Yancoal\nResources Ltd and Coal & Allied Industries Ltd (both wholly\nowned subsidiaries of Yancoal Australia Ltd) with a carrying value\nof $9,486 million as at 31 December 2018.\n\n\n**FUTURE PROSPECTS**\n\n\nYancoal will maintain strong cost discipline, with 2019 cash costs\n(excluding government royalties) expected to remain flat at around\nA$62.5/t (2018: A$63/t).\n\nFor 2019 Yancoal is targeting a dividend payout of 50% of net profit\nafter income tax (adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange hedge\nreserve movements and any other non-operating items).\n\n\n2019 guidance for saleable coal production is approximately 35 million\ntonnes (attributable). Expected 2019 capital expenditure is around\nA$285 million (attributable).\n\n\n**52** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\n\n\n**APPENDIX 4E**\n\n\n**1.

The increase of\n$24.2 million was attributable to the take-or-pay exposure acquired\nfrom the former Coal & Allied assets (full year $32.9 million) and underutilisation of WICET port capacity ($7.9 million). This was offset by a\n$16.6 million reduction from increased utilisation by Moolarben and\ntrading with third parties.\n\n\nYancoal continues to implement strategic measures to reduce\ntake‑or‑pay exposure across the Group by trading between sites\nand with other users.\n\n\nA review of the business of the Group during the year and a\ndiscussion on the Group’s future business development are provided\nin the Management Discussion and Analysis on pages 40 to 51 of this\nannual report.\n\n\nDescriptions of possible risks and uncertainties that the Group may\nbe facing can be found in the Corporate Governance Statement\non pages 90 to 98 of this annual report.

No security will be given\nby Watagan in favour of Yankuang. As the put bonds represent less\nthan 50.1% of the face value of the bonds, and the put option was\nnot exercised by the instructing bondholder, the put option is not\ndeemed to have been exercised as to all the bonds nor has control\nof Watagan been regained by the Group such that Watagan continues\nto be deconsolidated.\n\nOn 25 February 2019, Yancoal announced a final dividend of\nA$377 million (A$0.2855 per share to be comprised of an ordinary\ndividend of A$0.1596 and a special dividend of $0.1259), with a\nrecord date of 11 March 2019.

The maximum\n\n\n\nannual transaction amount to be received by the Group from POSCO\nand/or its associates for the sale of coal pursuant to the 2019 POSCO\nSales Agreements for the year ending 31 December 2019 will not\nexceed US$780 million.\n\n\nOther than as disclosed above, no matters or circumstances have\noccurred subsequent to the end of the financial period which have\nsignificantly affected, or may significantly affect, the operations of the\nGroup, the results of those operations or the state of affairs of the\nGroup in the subsequent financial period.\n\n\n**LIKELY DEVELOPMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**\n\n\nYancoal continues to pursue its long-term strategy for organic growth\nvia the progression of brownfield expansion and extension projects.\nKey projects include the conceptual underground mine at Mount\nThorley Warkworth with an estimated 6Mtpa ROM, with exploration\ndrilling for the prefeasibility on the target seams having been\ncompleted at the end of 2018.\n\n\nYancoal received approvals to commence mining activities associated\nwith the Lot 1 and Lot 2 areas of Mount Thorley Warkworth during the\nreporting period, enabling commencement of the expansion of the\nexisting West pit on the Warkworth side in 2019.\n\nProposed modifications for the Moolarben open cut pits are awaiting\napproval, as Yancoal continues to maximise improved extraction rates\nin both the open cut and underground mines.\n\n\nYancoal will maintain strong cost discipline, with 2019 cash costs\n(excluding government royalties) expected to remain flat at around\nA$62.5/t (2018: A$63/t). Guidance for saleable coal production in\n2019 is approximately 35 million tonnes (attributable).

Further, in 2018 Yancoal\nachieved a major milestone becoming dual listed on the main board of\nThe Stock Exchange of Hong Kong.\n\n\nConsequently, over 2018 the Nomination and Remuneration\nCommittee continued to review the Company’s remuneration\nframework to ensure remuneration arrangements were in line with\nsound corporate governance for an Australian and Hong Kong listed\ncompany and for a company of its size.\n\nIn 2018, the Committee engaged the consulting firm Aon\nHewitt Limited (“Aon Hewitt”) to provide independent market\nbenchmarking with respect to the remuneration of Yancoal\nexecutives and non-executive directors. This included providing\nremuneration recommendations to better align management with\nshareholder interests.\n\n\n\nTaking into account the Aon Hewitt recommendations and in order to\nmaintain executive remuneration arrangements that are competitive,\nconsistent with contemporary market practice and tailored to align\nwith Yancoal’s short-term and long-term strategic objectives, the\nBoard has implemented a new Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)\nduring the year and amended the existing Short Term Incentive\nPlan (“STIP”). These changes have been outlined in Section 3 of\nthis report. The key changes aimed to also strengthen shareholder\nalignment include:\n\n\n**STIP:** 50% of the STIP award will now be deferred over a two-year\nperiod (25% deferred for one year, remaining 25% deferred for two\nyears). These deferrals will be settled in either cash or equity.\n\n\n**LTIP:** In addition to the service condition, LTIP grants for 2018 will\nalso be subject to performance hurdles (measured over a three-year\nperiod) to assess vesting. Awards will be delivered in performance\nshare rights instead of cash.\n\n\nThe new plans were developed to reward short-term and longterm performance and are delivered in cash and equity to further\nstrengthen shareholder alignment.\n\n\nThis report sets out remuneration information for the Company’s Key\nManagement Personnel for the 12 months ended 31 December 2018.\n\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\n**Helen Jane Gillies**\n\n\nChair of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee\n\n\n**DIRECTORS’ REPORT** ANNUAL REPORT 2018 **65**\n\n\n**1.

Remuneration principles and framework**\nThe Company’s governing principles for remuneration are:\n\n\n–– to ensure remuneration is equitable, aligned with the long-term\ninterests of the Company and its shareholders and complies with\nrelevant Company policies, including the Diversity Policy;\n\n\n–– to provide market competitive remuneration and conditions to\nattract and retain skilled and motivated employees;\n\n\n–– to structure incentives to link reward with the achievement of the\nCompany’s strategies and challenging business objectives and to\nthe delivery of sustainable returns over the long term; and\n\n\n–– to reward based on performance, acknowledging the contribution\nof outstanding performers.\n\n\n2.1 Remuneration governance framework\nConsistent with its Board Charter, the Board oversees the\nappointment, remuneration and performance of all KMP other than\nDirectors and other members of the Executive Committee. On these\n\nissues, the Board receives recommendations from the Nomination\nand Remuneration Committee.\n\n\nThe Nomination and Remuneration Committee’s objective is to assist\nthe Board by making recommendations in relation to:\n\n\n–– Board composition and succession planning for the Board;\n\n\n–– remuneration levels and structure for KMP and other members of\nthe Executive Committee as appointed from time to time;\n\n\n–– the public reporting of remuneration for KMP and other members\nof the Executive Committee;\n\n\n–– the performance assessment of the Executive Committee;\n\n\n–– designing Company remuneration policy and regulations with\nregard to corporate governance; and\n\n\n–– diversity.\n\n\n**DIRECTORS’ REPORT** ANNUAL REPORT 2018 **69**\n\n\n2.2 Use of external remuneration advisors\n\nFrom time to time, the Remuneration Committee seeks and considers advice from external advisors who are engaged by and report directly to\nthe Remuneration Committee. Such advice will typically cover remuneration levels, independent benchmarking data and information regarding\nbest practice, trends and regulatory developments.\n\nIn 2018, the Committee engaged the consulting firm Aon Hewitt Limited (“Aon Hewitt”) to provide independent market benchmarking with\nrespect to the remuneration of Yancoal executives and non-executive directors. This included providing recommendations, as defined under\nthe Corporations Act 2001, on executive remuneration and executive incentive plan design for the financial year 2018 to the Committee.\n\nThe Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and Aon Hewitt are satisfied that the recommendations, relating to the executive\nremuneration structure and executive incentive plan design, have not been subject to any undue influence by the Executives to whom the\nrecommendations apply.\n\n\nTABLE 2: Remuneration Advisor Fees in 2018\n\n\n**2018**\n\n**Aon Hewitt** **$**\n\n\nRemuneration recommendations 83,500\n\nOther advice received 105,000\n\n**Total services remuneration** **188,500**\n\n\n**3. Executive remuneration**\n\n3.1 Objective\nRemuneration frameworks for Executives are structured to be market competitive and to reflect the reward strategy of the Company. Through\nthese frameworks the Company seeks to align remuneration for Executives with:\n\n\n_Shareholders’ interests by:_\n\n–– making economic performance a core component of the overall remuneration plan design;\n\n\n–– focusing on the key value drivers of the business including employee safety, operational performance and cost control; and\n\n\n–– attracting and retaining high calibre executives.\n\n\n_Executive’s interests by:_\n\n–– rewarding capability and experience;\n\n–– reflecting competitive reward for contribution to growth in Company performance;\n\n\n–– providing a clear structure for earning rewards; and\n\n\n–– providing recognition for contribution.\n\n\nDetails of remuneration for all Executives are set out in Table 10.\n\n\n3.2 Structure\nAll remuneration frameworks for Executives are structured as a combination of fixed and variable remuneration, as follows:\n\n\nTABLE 3: Executive remuneration structure\n\n\n**Current**\n\n**Fixed remuneration** –– Fixed Annual Remuneration (“FAR”), including cash salary, superannuation, and may include car allowance; and\n–– Other benefits (see Section 3.4).\n**Variable remuneration** –– Short-term Incentive (“STI”) (see Section 3.5.1); and\n(“at risk”) –– Long-term Incentive (“LTI”) (see Section 3.5.2).\n\n\n3.3 Remuneration mix at target remuneration\nThe chart below illustrates the relative proportion of remuneration entitlement for Executive KMP that is fixed and that which is linked to individual\nor Company performance or both (STIP and LTIP) to the extent target performance for at-risk components is met.\n\n\nTABLE 4: Components of Target Remuneration for Executive KMP for 2018\n\n\nFixed At risk STI (cash) At risk STI (deferred) At risk LTI\n\n\nCalculations for fixed remuneration entitlement include benefits but exclude the value of expatriate benefits; see Table 10. The short-term variable\nremuneration entitlement is determined pursuant to the STIP (outlined in Section 3.5.1). The LTIP is outlined in Section 3.5.2.\n\n\n**70** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\n\n\n**DIRECTORS’ REPORT** (CONTINUED)\n\n\n3.4 Fixed remuneration\nExecutives receive a Fixed Remuneration package, which incorporates cash salary, superannuation benefits and may include a provision for a\ncar allowance, together with various other benefits. Executives have some scope to determine the combination of cash (including car allowance)\nand various non-monetary benefits by which their FAR is delivered.\n\nEach Senior Executive’s level of fixed remuneration is reviewed annually to provide a base level of remuneration which is appropriate to the\nposition and competitive with companies of similar size in the mining/resources industry. No Executives are guaranteed an annual increase\nin FAR.\n\n\nIn 2018 the Remuneration Committee elected to increase remuneration for certain KMP to ensure remuneration remained competitive and\nconsistent with contemporary market practice following the benchmarking exercise conducted by Aon Hewitt.\n\n\n3.5 Variable remuneration\n\nVariable remuneration is delivered through participation in the STIP (as outlined in Section 3.5.1) whilst certain Executives are also eligible\nto participate in a LTIP (as outlined in Section 3.5.2).\n\n\n**3.5.1** **Short Term Incentive Plan**\n\nA new STIP structure was introduced in 2018 that strengthens shareholder alignment and encapsulates performance measures across several\ndifferent metrics. The Board has determined that Company performance goals best encapsulate KMP performance for the 2018 performance\nyear. As such individual performance goals do not form part of the performance metrics for the STIP for 2018 for the executives. The Board\nmaintains discretion to alter the scorecard outcomes outlined below if the scorecard results generate any unintended outcomes from a reward\nperspective considering the perspectives of various stakeholders including but not limited to shareholders, employees and communities.\n\n\n_Eligibility_\nThe STIP applies to Executives as well as other management and employees of the Company.\n\n\n_Objective_\nThe objective of the STIP is to reward Executives and employees for the achievements of the Company, Business Unit and individual goals that\nare aligned to the Company’s financial, operational and strategic priorities.\n\n\n_Structure_\n\nFor 2018 the STIP for KMPs comprised two key components:\n\n\n1. \u0007 **STIP Opportunity** – this is expressed as a percentage of the Executive’s FAR. The STIP opportunity is reviewed annually. A benchmarking\n\nexercise is completed against comparable peers in listed companies, and no changes were proposed for 2018. The CEO, CEC, CFO and\nCOO have a Target STIP opportunity of 100% of FAR, with a maximum opportunity of 200% of the Target STIP opportunity. The Board\nbelieves this level of STIP opportunity is reasonable and competitive for the current environment.\n\n\n2. **STIP Scorecard** – this consists of several Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”).\n\n\n\u0007At the start of each year, KPIs are reviewed and selected by Board as being the most appropriate to the business. Assessment against these\nmeasures is determined following the end of each year.\n\n\n\u0007For the Executives named in this report, all KPIs are measured at the Company level. The STIP Scorecard measures the Company’s\nperformance in respect of the following categories:\n\n\n**KPI** **Measure** **Weighting**\nProfitability Net Profit After Tax (“NPAT”) 30%\nFree On Board (“FOB”) Cash Costs (excluding royalties) 20%\nRun Of Mine tonnes (“ROM”) 10%\n\nHealth and Safety Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (“TRIFR”) 10%\n\nCritical Controls Compliance 5%\nStrategic Objectives Strategic measures may include special projects, capital management, 15%\ngrowth and culture development\n\nEnvironment Environmental incidents and complaints 10%\n\n\n\u0007STIP scorecard performance is assessed by the Chairman of the Executive Committee and the Chief Executive Officer, reviewed by the\nNomination and Remuneration Committee, and approved by the Board.\n\n\nPerformance against the STIP Scorecard is converted to a payout multiplier (calculated referencing the relevant maximum level of opportunity).\nThe payout multiplier is applied to the Target STIP opportunity to determine the actual STIP award. Accordingly, the Executive’s STIP award is\nheavily influenced by the achievement of Company KPIs.\n\n\n_Timing_\nFor any KMP STIP award:\n\n\n–– 50% of the award is delivered as a cash payment around April each year.\n\n\n–– 50% of the award will vest in equal parts over a two-year period (25% deferred for one year, remaining 25% deferred for two years)\nsubject to continued employment at the respective deferral dates. The deferred STIP will be settled in cash or equity.\n\n\n**DIRECTORS’ REPORT** ANNUAL REPORT 2018 **71**\n\n\n**3.5.2** **Long Term Incentive Plan**\nFollowing the recommendations provided by Aon Hewitt as part of the incentive design review, new LTIP grants for 2018 will also be subject to\nperformance hurdles (measured over a three-year period) to assess vesting outcomes. Awards will be delivered in performance share rights and\nwere granted on 30 May 2018.\n\n\nThe key characteristics of the LTIP are outlined below:\n\n\nTABLE 5: LTIP 2018 Structure\n\n\nEligibility Executives and certain senior management are eligible to participate in the LTIP.\nObjective The objective of the LTIP is to reward and retain participants who are in positions to influence the Company’s\nlong-term performance (the LTIP performance period is three years).\n\nFrequency Each year eligible Executives and certain senior management are considered for an annual LTIP grant.\nLTIP opportunity The Chair of the Executive Committee and the Chief Executive Officer have an annual LTIP opportunity\nbetween 100% and 200% of FAR.\nThe Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operations Officer have an LTIP opportunity of between 33% and\n50% of FAR.\n\nLTIP instrument The LTIP is issued via a grant of performance share rights for nil consideration. The Company may at its\ndiscretion settle an Executive’s and certain senior management’s LTIP in cash or shares.\n\nLTIP performance conditions The LTIP will vest subject to both service and performance measures over a three-year performance period:\n\n–– Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) Vesting Condition (“EPS Awards”): 60% of the award will vest subject to an EPS\ngrowth performance hurdle (“EPS Hurdle”), which compares the EPS performance of the Company with the\nEPS performance of a comparator group of companies operating in the Australian resources sectors over\nthe relevant performance period; and\n–– Costs Target Vesting Condition (“Costs Awards”): 40% of the award will vest subject to the Company\nachieving a defined cost per tonne target (“Costs Target Hurdle”) over the relevant performance period.\nLTIP performance conditions – The EPS Hurdle was chosen because:\nwhy were they chosen? a) It allows for an objective external assessment of the shareholder value created by the Company relative\n\nto a group of peers over a sustained period in view of the low liquidity and limited float of Yancoal shares;\nand\n\nb) It is a widely-adopted metric that is well understood by markets.\nThe Costs Target Hurdle was chosen and set at a level which provides a structural incentive to LTI participants\nto ensure that the Company remains positioned in the best cost quartile of Australian coal producers. Further,\nbest quartile costs protect and preserve shareholder value in difficult times and support enhanced returns\nwhen commodity cycles recover.\nHow will the performance For the EPS Hurdle, the EPS growth of the Company (based on the Company’s annual report, adjusted for any\ncondition be calculated for share consolidations or splits) is measured as a percentile ranking compared to the EPS growth for the same\nthe EPS Hurdle? period of the comparator group of companies operating in the Australian resources sectors.\n\n\nThe level of vesting will be determined based on the ranking in accordance with the following schedule:\n\n–– at the 75th percentile or above – 100% of the EPS Awards vest;\n\n–– between the 50th and 75th percentiles – vesting will occur on a pro-rata straight-line basis;\n–– at 50th percentile – 50% of the EPS Awards vest; and\n\n–– below the 50th percentile – no EPS Awards vest.\nPerformance Period –– Each EPS Award is capable of vesting and becoming exercisable after a three-year performance period with\nthe performance period commencing on 1 January 2018.\n–– The Costs Target Awards is based on the FOB cost per saleable tonne achieved on a Company-wide basis\nfor the year ending 30 December 2020 with Costs Target Awards being tested at, or shortly after, the time\nof publication of the independent expert’s report.\n\n–– All awards that do not vest following testing will lapse immediately. There is no re-testing. All vested awards\nare automatically exercised.\n\nAllocation Methodology The number of performance rights granted is calculated by dividing the dollar value of the annual LTI\nopportunity by the volume weighted average price of the Company’s ordinary shares traded on the ASX across\na 20-day trading period spread evenly either side of 31 December 2017.\n\n_The number of performance share rights was adjusted due to the 35:1 share consolidation undertaken by the_\n_Company in September 2018._\n\n\n**72** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\n\n\n**DIRECTORS’ REPORT** (CONTINUED)\n\n\n3.6 Linking Executive remuneration to Company performance\nThe Company’s remuneration principles include rewarding based on performance and this is primarily achieved through the Company’s STIP\nand LTIP. Cash and equity awards under these new plans continue to be significantly impacted by the overall performance of the Company in\norder to maintain a link between performance and shareholder value.

Details regarding\nthe proportion of men and women throughout the organisation are\nset out below.\n\n\nAs at 31 December 2018, the proportion of women who were\ndirectly employed by the Company as a whole was 10%: 299 Fulltime, 15 Part-time and four Casual. There was no change between\n2017 and 2018 in the percentage of females in comparison to the\npercentage of males. The proportion of women in senior management\nroles (being roles which directly report to the CEO or CEC) within\nthe Company during 2018 was 9%: Women held one of 11 senior\nmanagement roles within the Company.\n\n\nOn and from 30 January 2018, one female Non-Executive Director\nsits on the Board.\n\n\n\nPerformance of the Board, its Committees and individual Directors\n\nThe Nomination and Remuneration Committee oversees an annual\nevaluation process for the Board, its Committees and each Director\nbased on the Board Performance Evaluation Protocol ( **Protocol** )\nadopted and approved by the Board in 2012.\n\n\n_The Board_\n\nPeriodically, a review of the structure and operation of the Board,\nthe skills and characteristics required by the Board to maximise\nits effectiveness and whether the mix of skills, experience and\nexpertise and the Board’s practices and procedures are appropriate\nfor the present and future needs of the Company is conducted.\nThis evaluation of performance of the Board may be conducted\nwith the assistance of an external facilitator. As set out in the Board\nCharter, the review of the Board involves Directors providing written\nfeedback on the Board’s performance to the Chairman or to an\nexternal facilitator, which in turn is discussed by the Board, with\nconsideration of whether any steps for improvement are required.\n\n\nIt is expected that externally facilitated reviews will occur\napproximately every three years. The independent external facilitator\nwill seek input from each of the Directors and certain members of\nsenior management in relation to the performance of the Board\nagainst a set of agreed criteria.\n\n\nOnce an externally facilitated review occurs, the progress against any\nrecommendations from the most recent externally facilitated review,\ntogether with any new issues, will be considered internally.

The Company’s current\nIndependent Directors are Geoffrey Raby, Gregory Fletcher, David\nMoult (appointed 30 January 2018) and Helen Gillies (appointed\n30 January 2018). During their appointment, Vincent O’Rourke AM\n(resigned 30 January 2018) and Huaqiao Zhang (resigned 30 January\n2018) were each deemed to be Independent Directors.\n\n\nThe Board has assessed the independence of each of the\nNon‑Executive Directors (including the Chairman) in light of their\ninterests and relationships. A majority of the Board are not considered\nIndependent Directors having regard to their affiliation with the\n\n\n\nCompany’s major shareholder, Yanzhou, and accordingly the\nCompany does not comply with Recommendation 2.4 of the ASX\nRecommendation. However, the Board considers that its composition\nappropriately represents the interests of its shareholders including\nits major shareholder, Yanzhou, and that the Board has put in place\nappropriate policies and procedures to guide the Board and senior\nExecutives in circumstances where conflicts of interest may arise and\nin its dealings with Yanzhou, including establishing the Independent\nBoard Committee referred to above.\n\nTo help ensure that any conflicts of interest are identified, the\nCompany has put in place a standing agenda item at all meetings\nof the Board and its committees to provide the Directors with the\nopportunity of declaring any conflicts of interest in the subject matter\nof the proposed resolutions made within the meeting.\n\n\nTo assist the Board in making independent judgements, the Board\nCharter sets out the procedure by which the Board collectively, and\neach individual Director, can seek independent professional advice,\nat the Company’s expense.\n\n\nEach Independent Director must regularly provide the Board with\nall information relevant to their continued compliance with the\nindependence standard. The independence of Directors will be\nreviewed by the Board on a regular basis with assistance from the\nNomination and Remuneration Committee. The Nomination and\nRemuneration Committee will also assist the Board with regular\nevaluation of the performance of the Board, Board committees and\nindividual Directors.\n\nThe Independent Non-Executive Directors have confirmed their\nindependence in accordance with Rule 3.13 of the HK Listing Rules,\nand the Company has received from each of the Independent NonExecutive Directors an annual confirmation of his/her independence\nas required under Rule 3.13 of the HK Listing Rules. Accordingly, the\nCompany considers that the Independent Non-Executive Directors\ncontinue to be independent.\n\n\nIndependence Standard\nIn assessing the independence of its Directors, the Board has regard\nto the factors relevant to assessing the independence of a Director\nthat are set out in Box 2.3 of the ASX Recommendations (3rd edition)\nand Rule 3.13 of the HK Listing Rules. The criteria considered in\nassessing the independence of Non‑Executive Directors are also set\nout in the Board Charter.\n\n\nA Director is considered independent if the Director:\n\n\n–– is not, and has not within the last three years been, employed in\nan executive capacity by the Company or any of its child entities;\n\n\n–– is not, nor has within the last three years been, a partner, Director\nor senior employee of a provider of material professional services\nto the Company or any of its child entities;\n\n\n–– is not, nor has within the last three years been, in a material\nbusiness relationship with the Company or any of its child entities,\nor an officer of, or otherwise associated with, someone with such\na relationship;\n\n–– is not a substantial Shareholder of the Company or an officer\nof, or otherwise associated with, a substantial Shareholder of\nthe Company;\n\n\n–– does not have a material contractual relationship with the\nCompany or any of its child entities other than as a Director;\n\n\n–– does not have close family ties with any person who falls within\nany of the categories described above;\n\n\n–– has not been a Director of the Company for such a period that\nhis or her independence may have been compromised; and\n\n\n–– is free from any other interest, position, association or relationship\nthat might interfere, or might reasonably be seen to interfere, with\nthe Director’s capacity to bring an independent judgement to bear\non issues before the Board and to act in the best interests of the\nCompany and its shareholders generally.\n\n\nThe Company’s Constitution provides that the Company’s shareholders\nholding a majority of the issued shares of the Company (which confer\nthe right to vote) may nominate a Director to the office of Chairman\nand may elect one or more Directors to the office of Vice Chair.\n\n\nAlthough as a nominee of Yanzhou, Baocai Zhang, the Chairman,\nis not considered independent by the independence standard (as\nabove), the Board considers that this is an appropriate reflection of\nYanzhou’s majority shareholding in the Company. While a majority\nof the Directors are associated with Yanzhou this is considered\nappropriate in light of Yanzhou’s major shareholding in the Company.\n\n\nBoard skills matrix\n\nThe Board represents a balance of skills, experience and\ndiversity of perspectives appropriate to the requirements of the\nCompany’s business.\n\n\nThe table below sets out the skills and experience that are currently\nrepresented on the Board.\n\n\n\n**CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT** ANNUAL REPORT 2018 **87**\n\n\n**Skills and Experiences** **Total**\n\nMining/exploration and production 4\n\nEngineering 4\nCapital projects 10\nTrading/marketing 4\nStrategy 11\n\nLeadership 11\n\nBoard/Committee experience 8\nCorporate governance 7\nAccounting/audit/risk management 7\nGovernment/policy 9\nLegal/regulatory 5\n\nHealth, safety and environment 6\n\nHuman resources 5\n\nInternational business expertise 9\n\n\nInduction and professional development\nUpon appointment, Directors are provided with an information\npack containing a letter of appointment setting out the Company’s\nexpectations, Directors’ duties and the terms and conditions of their\nappointment, and other materials containing information about the\nCompany including the Company’s Constitution, charters and policies\nto support the induction of Directors to the Board.\n\n\nDirectors also participate in continuing education or development\nprograms arranged for them, including for example training on\nDirectors’ duties and developments in workplace health and\nsafety law.\n\n\nIn preparation for the HK Listing, all Directors undertook training in\nrespect of matters relating to the HK Listing (including in respect of\nthe principles in the HK Code) and its interaction with the ASX Listing\nRules on 12 June 2018 (English) and 14 June 2018 (Chinese).

The policy also protects individuals who\nin good faith report misconduct which they reasonably believe to be\ncorrupt, illegal or unethical on a confidential basis, without fear of\nreprisal, dismissal or discriminatory treatment; and assists in ensuring\nthat matters of misconduct and/or unethical behaviour are identified\nand dealt with appropriately.\n\nIndividuals can report their concerns confidentially online, via\nconfidential email to an external facilitator or by telephoning a\nconfidential Speak Up Line.\n\n\nAll disclosures made under this policy will be treated seriously and\nbe the subject of a thorough investigation with the objective of\nlocating evidence that either substantiates or refutes the misconduct\ndisclosed by an employee. Such investigations will be facilitated\nindependently from the business unit concerned, the employee who\nmade the disclosure or any person being the subject of the reportable\nconduct. The Company will determine, based on the seriousness of\nthe disclosure, whether the investigation will be conducted internally\nby a senior member of management or the external facilitator.\n\n\n**Principle 4: Safeguard integrity in corporate reporting**\nAudit and Risk Management Committee\nThe Board is responsible for preparing the financial statements and\naccounts of the Company. The Board has established an Audit and\nRisk Management Committee, which plays a key role in helping the\nBoard to oversee financial reporting, internal control structure, risk\nmanagement systems and internal and external audit functions.\nThe committee also enables the Board to maintain a transparent\nrelationship with the Company’s internal and external auditors.\n\n\nThe committee has the necessary power and resources to meet\nits responsibilities under its charter, including rights of access\nto management and auditors (internal and external) and to seek\nexplanations and additional information.

The external auditor also attends\nthe Company’s Annual General Meeting to answer questions from\nshareholders relevant to the Company’s audit.\n\n\nThe statement of the external auditor, ShineWing Australia, about\nreporting responsibilities on the financial statements of the Group,\nis set out under the heading “Independent Auditor’s Report to the\nMembers of Yancoal Australia Ltd” in this annual report.\n\n\nThe Directors confirm that, to the best of their knowledge, information\nand belief, having made all reasonable enquiries, they are not aware\nof any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that may\ncast significant doubt upon the Company’s ability to continue as a\ngoing concern.\n\n\nAn analysis of remuneration (including details of the amounts\npayable) to the auditor for audit and non-audit services provided\nduring the financial year ended 31 December 2018 is set out in\nthe Directors’ Report on pages 64 to 77.\n\n\n**Principle 5: Make timely and balanced disclosure**\nThe Company recognises the importance of timely and adequate\ndisclosure to the market, and is committed to making timely\nand balanced disclosure of all material matters and to effective\ncommunication with its shareholders and investors so as to give\nthem ready access to balanced and understandable information.\nThe Company also works together with its major shareholder,\nYanzhou, to ensure that Yanzhou can comply with its disclosure\nobligations in relation to Company information, and vice versa,\nYanzhou seeks to ensure that the Company can comply with its\ndisclosure obligations in relation to Yanzhou’s information.\n\n\nThe Board has put in place a Disclosure Policy to encapsulate the\ndisclosure obligations under the Corporations Act 2001 and the ASX\nListing Rules and to set out procedures for managing compliance\nwith those obligations. This policy was revised in October 2018 to\n\n\ncapture the relevant disclosure obligations under the HK Listing Rules.\nThese procedures provide a framework for managing the disclosure\nof material matters to the market to ensure accountability at Board\nand senior Executive level. As part of this framework, a standing\nagenda item at all the Company’s Board and Executive Committee\nmeetings requires the Directors and senior Executives to consider\nwhether any matters at the meeting should be disclosed to the\nmarket. The Disclosure Policy can be found within the Corporate\nGovernance section of the Company’s website.\n\n\nA Disclosure Committee has been established to assist the Company\nto meet its disclosure obligations. The Committee plays a key role\nin reviewing and determining whether information is likely to have a\nmaterial effect on the price or value of the Company’s securities such\nthat it requires disclosure to the market. The Disclosure Committee\nmembers comprise the CEC, CEO, CFO, Company Secretary,\nInvestor Relations General Manager and Group Counsel.\n\n\nAny information disclosed to the market through an announcement\nto the ASX is also published on the Investor section of the\nCompany’s website.\n\n\n**Principle 6: Respect the rights of shareholders**\n\nCommunications with shareholders\n\nThe Company has an investor relations program that is aimed at\nfacilitating two-way communications with investors. The Company’s\npolicy is to promote effective communication with shareholders\nand other investors so that they understand how to assess relevant\ninformation about the Company and its corporate direction. The\nCompany aims to keep shareholders, potential investors and other\nstakeholders informed of all major developments affecting the state\nof affairs of the Company. The Company communicates information\nregularly to shareholders, potential investors and other stakeholders by:\n\n\n–– posting announcements on the ASX and HKEx platforms in\naccordance with its continuous disclosure obligations and also\nmaking these announcements available on the Company’s website;\n\n\n–– keeping its website up to date on important information about the\nCompany, including its Constitution, Board and Board Committee\nCharters, core corporate governance policies and financial\ninformation about the Company; and\n\n\n–– publishing investor presentations made to analysts and making\nmedia briefings available within the Investor section of the\nCompany’s website.\n\n\nThe Board considers one of its key responsibilities to be\ncommunication with shareholders and, accordingly, the Company\nencourages shareholders to attend and participate in all general\nmeetings including annual general meetings.\n\n\nShareholders are entitled to ask questions about the management\nof the Company and of the auditor as to its conduct of the audit and\npreparation of its reports. Any shareholders who cannot attend any\ngeneral meetings can also participate via lodgement of their proxies.\nIn addition, shareholders have the option of receiving communications\nfrom and sending communications to the Company and the Company’s\nprinciple and branch share registries, Computershare Investor\nServices, electronically.\n\n\nThe Company’s Shareholder Communication Policy, which was\nreviewed and approved by the Board in October 2018 to capture the\nrelevant requirements of the HK Listing Rules, can be found within the\nCorporate Governance section of the Company’s website.\n\n\nParagraph 44 of the HK Joint Policy Statement requires that members\nholding a minority stake in an overseas company must be allowed to\nconvene an extraordinary general meeting and add resolutions to a\n\n\n\n**CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT** ANNUAL REPORT 2018 **89**\n\n\nmeeting agenda. The minimum level of members’ support required to\nconvene a meeting must be no higher than 10%.\n\n\nUnder section 249D of the Australian Corporations Act, Shareholders\nwith at least 5% of the votes that may be cast at a general meeting\nmay request the Directors to call a general meeting or may convene\na general meeting themselves at their own expense under section\n249F of the Australian Corporations Act. Any such request must be in\nwriting, must state any resolution to be proposed at the meeting, must\nbe signed by the shareholder making the request and must be given\nto the Company.\n\n\nUnder section 249N of the Australian Corporations Act, Shareholders\nrepresenting at least 5% of the total votes that may be cast on the\nresolution or at least 100 Shareholders who are entitled to vote at a\ngeneral meeting may give the Company notice requiring resolutions to\nbe put before a general meeting. The notice must be in writing, must\nset out the wording of the proposed resolution and must be signed by\nthe shareholders proposing to move the resolution.\n\n\nApart from the general meetings, the Company’s website is\nan effective means of communication with Shareholders. Any\nShareholders who have questions or comments on what the\nCompany is doing are most welcome to contact the Company at any\ntime through the website. Shareholders may raise enquiries to the\nBoard by contacting the Group’s Investor Relations team, including\nat shareholder@yancoal.com.au. Upon receipt of the enquiries, the\nInvestor Relations team will forward the Shareholders’ enquiries\nand concerns to the Board, Board committees or the management\nas appropriate.\n\n\nAmendments to the Company’s Constitution\nAt a general meeting of Shareholders held on 26 September 2018,\nShareholder approval to amend the Constitution was sought and\nobtained. The Constitution was amended by:\n\na) \u0007Amending the definition of “Exchange” by replacing the word “or”\n\nwith the word “and” in the first line, so the definition reads:\n\n\n\u0007“ASX Limited and such other body corporate that is declared by\nthe Directors to be the Company’s primary stock exchange for the\npurposes of this definition.”\n\n\nb) Inserting a new rule 7.9(u) as follows:\n\n\n\u0007“For the purposes of this rule 7.9, a recognised clearing house\n(within the meaning of the Securities and Futures Ordinance\n(Chapter 571 of the laws of Hong Kong) or its nominee(s) may\nappoint or authorise any number of proxy(ies), attorney(s) or\nRepresentative(s) to cast votes attaching to voting shares that\nit holds in the Company, provided that if two or more proxies,\nattorneys or Representatives are appointed or authorised to vote\nat the same general meeting, the proxy form or authorisation must\nspecify the number and class of voting shares in respect of which\neach proxy, attorney or Representative is appointed or authorised\nto vote. Each person so authorised under the provisions of this\nconstitution shall be deemed to have been duly authorised without\nfurther evidence of the facts and be entitled to exercise the same\npower on behalf of the recognised clearing house as that clearing\nhouse or its nominee(s) could exercise as if it were an individual\nshareholder of the Company.”\n\n\nc) Inserting a new rule 11.2 as follows:\n\n\n\u0007“Subject to applicable laws, regulations and the Listing Rules\nand notwithstanding any other rules in this Constitution, the\nCompany or the Directors may fix any date as the record date for:\n\n\n(a) \u0007determining the members entitled to receive any dividend,\n\ndistribution, allotment or issue;\n\n\n**90** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\n\n\n**CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT** (CONTINUED)\n\n\n\n(b) \u0007determining the members entitled to receive notice of,\n\nand to vote at, any general meeting of the Company; and\n\n\n(c) \u0007any other corporate action requiring a record date to be set.”\n\n\n**Principle 7: Recognise and manage risk**\nRisk identification and management\nThe Board, through the Audit and Risk Management Committee,\nis responsible for satisfying itself that a sound system of risk oversight\nand management exists and that internal controls are effective\nto enable it to assess the type and extent of relevant risks in its\ndecision making.\n\n\nIn particular, the Board ensures that:\n\n–– the material strategic, operational, financial reporting\nand compliance risks are identified and evaluated; and\n\n\n–– risk management, control and reporting systems are in place\nto identify, assess, manage, monitor and report on these risks.\n\n\nThe role and membership of the Audit and Risk Management\nCommittee are described under Principles 2 and 4.\n\n\nThe Company’s Audit and Risk Management Committee Charter\ncan be found within the Corporate Governance section of the\nCompany’s website.\n\n\nThe Board has requested the Company’s senior Executives\nand management to report to the Audit and Risk Management\nCommittee and, where appropriate the Board, regarding the effective\nmanagement of its material business risks.\n\n\nIn 2018, the Audit and Risk Management Committee had in place a\nframework to identify, assess and manage risks that are material to\nthe business. This framework includes:\n\n\n–– implementation of a corporate risk management standard\napproved by the Audit and Risk Management Committee\nand Board;\n\n–– identification of material business risks by reference to a corporate\nrisk register, approved by the Audit and Risk Management\nCommittee and Board;\n\n–– formal risk identification activities being undertaken at both\na functional level and at each of the Company’s mine sites;\n\n\n–– designated individuals across the business that have accountability\nfor the implementation of risk management within their areas\nof responsibility;\n\n\n–– the GM of Risk and Assurance as a central resource available\nto assist with all risk management responsibilities, and to assist\nwith any training/awareness or other related requirements; and\n\n\n–– adherence to internal procedures and plans for crisis management.\n\n\nThe Audit and Risk Management Committee receives periodic reports\non the performance of the Company’s risk management framework,\nas well as on the Company’s key risk exposures to satisfy itself that\nit continues to be sound. A review of the risk management framework\nwas conducted in 2018 that addressed areas for continuous\nimprovement in line with the Australian/New Zealand standard for risk\nmanagement. The framework was considered effective.\n\n\n\nFormal risk identification activities are undertaken on a periodic basis;\nwith Risk Identification and Analysis undertaken at a functional level,\nas well as at each of the Company’s mine sites. In addition, where\nappropriate, project-specific risk assessments are conducted.\n\n\nThe GM of Risk and Assurance is responsible for establishing\nand managing the Company-wide risk management framework,\nrisk management system and practices, reviewing the impact of\nthe risk management framework on its control environment and\ninsurance arrangements and reviewing the risk of major investment\nprojects. Together with the CEC, the Board and the Audit and\nRisk Management Committee, the GM of Risk and Assurance is\nresponsible for developing a risk matrix and framework and for\nimplementing related risk-based assurance processes for the\nCompany and its subsidiaries. The GM of Risk and Assurance\nannually confirms the continued effectiveness of the risk framework\nto the Audit and Risk Management Committee.\n\n\nThe responsibility for managing risks, risk controls or risk management\naction plans is embedded within the business and undertaken as\npart of everyday activities. The Board recognises and acknowledges\nthat, while risk management controls and systems can be effective\nin managing risks, they cannot eliminate all risks relevant to the\nCompany achieving its objectives and cannot provide absolute\nassurance against material misstatement or loss.\n\n\nRisks associated with the Company\nThe future operating performance of the Group may be affected by\nrisks relating to the Company’s business. Some of these risks are\nspecific to the Company while others relate to economic conditions\nand the general industry and markets in which the Company operates.\n\n\nThe Company’s risk management policies and procedures have\nbeen designed and implemented to identify, assess and manage\nany material exposure to risks relating to the Company’s business,\nincluding economic, environmental and social sustainability risks.\nThe Company undertakes regular monitoring and assessment of\nthese risks and implements risk treatment strategies to manage\nits exposure to such risks. However, there can be no assurance\nthat such risk mitigation strategies will protect the Company from\nthese risks. Other risks are beyond the Company’s control and\ncannot be mitigated. The occurrence of any such risks could\nadversely affect the Company’s financial condition and performance.\nThe risks listed below are not purported to be exhaustive and there\nis no assurance that the importance of different risks will not change\nor other risks will not emerge.\n\n\nThe table below identifies risks which are considered to be economic,\nenvironmental and/or social sustainability risks.\n\n\n\n**CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT** ANNUAL REPORT 2018 **91**\n\n\n_Operating risks_\nThe Company’s operations are subject to operating risks that\ncould result in decreased coal production which could reduce their\nrespective revenues. Operational difficulties may impact the amount\nof coal produced, delay coal deliveries or increase the cost of mining\nfor a varying length of time. These operating risks include (but are not\nlimited to) industrial action, mine collapses, cave-ins or other failures\nrelating to mine infrastructure, including tailings dams, interruptions\ndue to inclement or hazardous weather conditions, power interruption,\ncritical equipment failure (in particular any protracted breakdown\nor issues with any of the Company’s CHPPs or a major excavator),\nfires, and explosions from methane gas or coal dust, accidental mine\nwater discharges, flooding and variations in or unusual or unexpected\ngeological or geotechnical mining conditions (particularly in the\nCompany’s underground operations). Such risks could result in\ndamage to applicable mines, personal injury, environmental damage,\ndelays in coal production, decreased coal production, loss of revenue,\nmonetary losses and possible legal liability. Although the Company’s\ninsurance policies provide coverage for some of these risks, the\namount and scope of insurance cover is limited by market and\neconomic factors and there can be no assurance that these risks\nwould be fully covered by insurances maintained by the Company.\n\n\n_Injury or accident risks_\nIf any injuries or accidents occur in a mine, this could have adverse\nfinancial implications including legal claims for personal injury, wrongful\ndeath, amendments to approvals, potential production delays or\nstoppages, any of which may have a material adverse effect on the\nfinancial performance and/or financial position of the Company.\n\n\n_Funding risks_\nThe amount of future funding required by the Company will depend\non a number of factors, including the performance of the Company’s\nbusiness at that time. The Company’s business operations and\ncash flow are highly sensitive to any fluctuation in the US$ coal price,\ncoal production from its operations, demand for its coal product and\nUS$ movement in foreign exchange rates, particularly movements in\nthe A$:US$ exchange rate.\n\n\nIn developing its business plan and operating budget, the Company\nhas made certain assumptions regarding coal prices, the A$:US$\nexchange rate, future production levels and other factors which\ndetermine the Company’s financial performance.\n\n\nIf a funding shortfall materialises, the Company may need to raise\nsubstantial additional debt or equity. The Company’s capacity to\nsecure the requisite level of funding will depend on the amount\nof funding required, the performance and future prospects of its\nbusiness and a number of other factors, including US$ coal prices,\ninterest rates, economic conditions, debt market conditions, equity\nmarket conditions and future levels of Yanzhou support.\n\n\nTo the extent that the Company is not able to secure additional\nfinancing (whether debt or equity) on acceptable terms from third\nparties, the Company will continue to rely on financial support\nfrom Yanzhou.\n\n\nAs at 31 December 2018, the Company had a loan receivable from\nWatagan of A$813 million (re-drawable up to A$1.36 billion) which\nis subject to impairment testing. There is a guarantee provided\nby Yankuang (being the ultimate parent entity of the Company) to\nindemnify the Company for any amounts due and payable under the\nloan which are not paid by Watagan.\n\n\n\n**Economic**\n\n**sustainability**\n\n\n\n**Environmental**\n\n\n**sustainability**\n\n\n\n**Social**\n\n**sustainability**\n\n\n\n**risks** **risks** **risks**\n\n\nOperating risks ü ü ü\n\nInjury or accident risks ü ü\n\nFunding risks ü\n\nAdverse foreign exchange ü\nrate movements\n\n\n\n**risks**\n\n\n\n**risks**\n\n\n\nü\n\n\n\nHedging through bank-issued\ninstruments\n\n\n\nü\n\n\n\nCoal prices and coal demand risk ü\n\nCoal production risks ü\n\nDebt costs ü\n\nTaxation risks ü\n\nAustralia Accounting Standards ü\n\nRegulatory approvals risks ü ü\n\nEstimates of Resources and ü\nReserves and geology\n\n\nTake or pay liabilities ü\n\nUncertainty in costs forecast ü\n\nNCIG and WICET debt ü\n\nMine closure ü ü ü\n\nCoal supply agreement ü\n\nJoint ventures and ü\nreliance on third parties\n\nCompetition ü\n\nTitle risks ü\n\nNative Title ü ü\n\nOverlapping tenement risks ü ü\n\nEnforcement and counterparty ü\ninsolvency risks\n\n\nCoal royalties ü\n\nClimate change/ ü ü ü\ncarbon regulation risks\n\n\nTechnological change ü ü\n\nTechnology ü\n\nKey personnel ü\n\nFraud or misconduct ü ü\n\nEnvironmental activism ü ü ü\n\nChanges in government policy, ü\nregulation or legislation\n\n\nEnvironment and planning ü ü\n\nLitigation ü ü\n\nInsurance ü\n\nExploration and development risks ü\n\nTransport and infrastructure ü\n\nEnvironmental risks ü ü ü\n\nHealth, safety and hazardous ü ü ü\nmaterials risks\n\n\nImpairment risks ü\n\n\n**92** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\n\n\n**CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT** (CONTINUED)\n\n\n\nYanzhou’s and Yankuang’s capacity to meet their respective funding\ncommitments will depend on their financial position at the time and\ntheir capacity to raise the necessary funds to meet the commitments.\nYancoal’s capacity to source further funding from Yanzhou will depend\non Yanzhou’s willingness and financial capacity to provide that\nfunding. There can be no assurance that Yanzhou will be in a position\nto provide financial support to Yancoal or that Yankuang will be in a\nposition to meet its obligations under the guarantee in respect of the\nWatagan Agreements.\n\n\n_Adverse foreign exchange rate movements_\nForeign exchange risk is the risk of the Company sustaining loss\nthrough adverse movements in exchange rates. Such losses\ncan impact the Company’s financial position and performance\nand the level of additional funding required to support the\nCompany’s businesses.\n\nThe liabilities, earnings and cash flows of the Company are influenced\nby movements in exchange rates, especially movements in the\nA$:US$ exchange rate.\n\n\nWhile the Company operates entirely in Australia and its costs\nare primarily denominated in its functional currency, the A$,\nforeign currency exposure arises particularly in relation to coal\nsupply contracts, which generally are priced and payable in US$,\nprocurement of imported plant and equipment, which can be priced\nin US$ or other foreign currencies, and debt denominated in US$.\n\n\nThe impact of exchange rate movements will vary depending\non factors such as the nature, magnitude and duration of the\nmovements, the extent to which currency risk is hedged under\nforward exchange contracts or other hedging instruments and the\nterms of these contracts.\n\n\nThe hedging policy of the Company aims to protect against the\nvolatility of cash expenditures or reduced collection in the above\nmentioned transactions as well as to reduce the volatility of profit\nor loss for retranslation of US dollar denominated loans at each\nperiod end.\n\n\n_Hedging through bank-issued instruments_\nOperating foreign exchange risk that arises from firm commitments\nor highly probable transactions is managed through the use of bank\nissued forward foreign currency contracts and collar option contracts.\nThe Company hedges a portion of contracted US dollar sales and\nasset purchases settled in foreign currencies in each currency to\nmitigate the adverse impact on cash flow due to the future rise or fall\nin Australian dollars against the relevant currencies.\n\n\n_Coal prices and coal demand risk_\nThe Company generates revenue from the sale of coal. In developing\nits business plan and operating budget, the Company makes certain\nassumptions regarding coal prices and demand for coal. The prices\nwhich the Company will receive for its coal depend on numerous\nmarket factors beyond its control and, accordingly, some underlying\ncoal price assumptions relied on by the Company may materially\nchange and actual coal prices and demand may differ materially from\nthose expected.\n\n\n\nThe prices for coal are determined predominantly by world markets,\nwhich are affected by numerous factors, including the outcome of\nfuture sale contract negotiations, general economic activity, industrial\nproduction levels, changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in\nenergy demand and demand for steel, changes in the supply of\nseaborne coal, technological changes, changes in production levels\nand events interfering with supply, changes in international freight\nrates or other transportation infrastructure and costs, the costs of\nother commodities and substitutes for coal, market changes in coal\nquality requirements, government regulations which restrict use of\ncoal, and tax impositions on the resources industry, all of which are\noutside the control of the Company and may have a material adverse\nimpact on coal prices and demand.\n\n\nIn addition, the coal price is highly dependent on the outlook for coal\nconsumption in large Asian economies, such as China, Japan and\nIndia, as well as any changes in government policy regarding coal\nor energy policy in those countries.\n\nAbsent offsetting factors, significant and sustained adverse\nmovements in demand for coal and, consequently, coal prices (both\ngenerally and in relation to particular types and classes of coal) may\nhave a material adverse impact on the ongoing financial performance\nand financial position of the Company or may result in the Company\nnot proceeding with the development of new mines and projects due\nto such development not being economically viable.\n\n\nAny weakening in coal prices or any deterioration prompted by further\nreduction in demand or addition of new tonnes to the seaborne\nmarket (for example from thermal coal exports from the US) would\nhave a material adverse impact on the financial performance of the\nCompany and its capacity to undertake development projects.\n\n\n_Coal production risks_\nImprovement in the Company’s financial performance is dependent\non the Company being able to sustain or increase coal production\nand decrease operating costs on a per tonne basis. The Company’s\nsuccess or failure in improving productivity will become particularly\nimportant to the Company’s financial performance if the coal price\nremains at current levels or falls further.\n\n\nThe Company’s coal production can be impacted by a number\nof factors, including unforeseen geological or geotechnical issues\n(particularly in the Company’s underground operations), changes or\nvariations in coal quality or geological, hydrologic or other conditions,\nadverse weather including abnormal wet weather conditions\n(particularly in Queensland), unforeseen delays or complexities\nin installing and operating mining longwall systems, protracted\nbreakdown of coal handling infrastructure and other mining equipment\nand rail and port breakdowns and outages. Regulatory factors and the\noccurrence of other operating risks can also limit production.\n\n\n_Debt costs_\n\nThe majority of the Company’s loans are US$ LIBOR based\nfloating rate loans and currently there are no interest rate hedging\narrangements in place. As a result, any increase in the US$ LIBOR\nfrom current levels will expose the Company to higher debt costs.\n\n\n_Taxation risks_\n\nIn addition to the corporate income tax imposed on the Company, the\nCompany is required to pay government royalties, direct and indirect\ntaxes and other imposts in the jurisdictions in which the Company will\noperate. The Company may be affected by changes in government\ntaxation and royalty policies or in the interpretation or application of\nsuch policies under Australian laws.\n\nThe potential of the Company to obtain the benefit of existing\ntax losses and claim other tax attributes will depend on future\ncircumstances and may be affected by changes in ownership of\nboth Yanzhou and Yancoal, business activities, thin capitalisation\nthresholds, tax bases and any other conditions relating to the use\nof tax losses or other attributes of the Group. The ability to use the\nCompany’s carried forward losses will depend on the Company’s\ncontinued satisfaction of the loss recoupment tests under Australian\ntax laws and be subject to the availability of sufficient future\ntaxable profits.\n\n\n_Australian Accounting Standards (AAS)_\nAAS are issued by the AASB and are beyond the control of\nthe Company and the Directors. Any changes to AAS or to the\ninterpretation of those standards may have an adverse effect on the\nreported financial performance or financial position of the Company.\n\n\nIn particular, the accounting treatment for transactions such as\nthe transfer of the NSW mining assets of Ashton, Austar and\nDonaldson to Watagan could be reviewed by standard setters\nand may be subject to change. In the event that the Company is\nrequired to reconsolidate Watagan’s results and financial position\ninto its consolidated financial statements ahead of the scheduled\ndate in 2025, due to a change to AAS or their interpretation, the\nreconsolidation may have an adverse effect on the reported financial\nperformance or financial position of the Company.\n\n\n_Regulatory approvals risks_\nThe ability of the Company to meet its long-term production target\nprofile depends on (amongst other things) the Company being able\nto obtain on a timely basis, and maintain, all necessary regulatory\napprovals (including any approvals arising under applicable mining\nlaws, environmental regulations and other laws) for its current\noperations and expansion and growth projects, including obtaining\nplanning approvals, land access, land owner consents and addressing\nany native title issues, impacts on the environment and objections\nfrom local communities.\n\n\nThe requirement to obtain approvals and to address potential and\nactual issues for existing and future mining projects is common to\nall companies in the coal sector. However, there is no assurance\nor guarantee that the Company will be in a position to secure any\nor all of the required consents, approvals and rights necessary to\nmaintain its current production profile from its existing operations or to\ndevelop its growth projects in a manner which will result in profitable\nmining operations and the achievement of its long-term production\ntargets. If these approvals (or other approvals required for the planned\nproduction increases) are not obtained, or if conditional or limited\napprovals are obtained, the economic viability of the relevant projects\nmay be adversely affected, which may in turn result in the value of the\nrelevant assets being impaired.\n\n\nThe Company continues to engage openly and transparently with all\nState and Federal Government and approval bodies, while operating\nto the highest safety, environmental and legislative standards to work\ntowards facilitating all approvals in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n**CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT** ANNUAL REPORT 2018 **93**\n\n\n_Estimates of Resources and Reserves and geology_\nThe volume and quality of the coal that the Company recovers may\nbe less than the Resource and Reserve estimates reported to date.\nResource and Reserve estimates are expressions of judgement based\non knowledge, experience and industry practice. There are risks\nassociated with such estimates, including that coal mined may be of\na different quality or grade, tonnage or strip ratio from those in the\nestimates and the ability to economically extract and process the coal\nmay not eventuate. Resource and Reserve estimates are necessarily\nimprecise and depend to some extent on interpretations and\ngeological assumptions, coal prices, cost assumptions, and statistical\ninferences which may ultimately prove to have been unreliable.\n\n\nCoal Resource and Coal Reserve estimates are regularly revised\nbased on actual production experience or new information and could\ntherefore be expected to change. Furthermore, should the Company\nencounter mineralisation or formations different from those predicted\nby past drilling, sampling and similar examinations, Coal Resource\nand Coal Reserve estimates may have to be adjusted and mining\nplans, coal processing and infrastructure may have to be altered in\na way that might adversely affect their operations. If it is determined\nthat mining of certain Coal Reserves is uneconomic, this may lead to\na reduction in the Company’s aggregate Coal Reserve estimates.\n\n\nMaterial changes in Coal Reserve estimates, grades, strip ratios,\nwashing yields or recovery rates may affect the economic viability\nof projects. Coal Reserve estimates should not be interpreted\nas assurances of mine life or of the profitability of current or\nfuture operations.\n\n\nIf the Company’s actual Coal Resource and Coal Reserve estimates\nare less than current estimates, the Company’s prospects, value,\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition may be\nmaterially adversely affected.\n\n\n_Take or pay liabilities_\nPort and rail (above rail and below rail) capacity is generally contracted\nvia long-term take-or-pay contracts. The Company will generally be\nrequired to pay for its contracted rail or port tonnage irrespective of\nwhether it is utilised. Unused port or rail capacity can arise as a result\nof circumstances including insufficient production from a given mine,\na mismatch between port and rail capacity for a mine, or an inability\nto transfer the used capacity due to contractual limitations such as\nrequired consent of the provider of the port or rail services, or because\nthe coal must emanate from specified source mines or be loaded onto\ntrains at specified load points.\n\n\n_Uncertainty in costs forecast_\nThe business operations and financial condition of the Company\nmay vary with fluctuations in production and capital costs. Changes\nin the costs of mining and processing operations as well as capital\ncosts could occur, including as a result of unforeseen events, such\nas international and local economic and political events (including\nmovement in exchange rates) or unexpected geological or mining\nconditions, and could have material adverse financial consequences\nfor the Company.\n\n\n_NICG and WICET debt_\n\nAs a shipper in NCIG and WICET, the Company’s source mines are\nrequired to maintain a minimum level of Marketable Coal Reserves\n(11 years’ worth of contracted capacity). Non-compliance with this\nrequirement would result in the termination of the individual contracts\nand require the Company to pay its share of any outstanding senior\ndebt, amortised over the remaining 10 years of that particular\ncontract. The Company’s current share of the outstanding senior\ndebt is approximately A$1 billion and A$0.3 billion, respectively.\n\n\n**94** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\n\n\n**CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT** (CONTINUED)\n\n\n\n_Mine closure_\n\nClosure of any of the mines or other operations of the Company\nbefore the end of their mine life (e.g. due to environmental,\ngeological, geotechnical, commercial and/or health and safety\nissues), could trigger significant employee redundancy costs, closure\nand rehabilitation expense and other costs or loss of revenues.\nMany of these costs will also be incurred where mines are closed at\nthe end of their planned mine life or placed on care and maintenance.\nA move to care and maintenance has the potential to trigger\nsignificant employee redundancy costs and a subsequent loss of\nrevenues, as a minimal employee presence is required for ongoing\nmanagement and rehabilitation of the mines.\n\n\nIf one or more of the relevant sites are closed earlier than anticipated,\nthe Company will be required to fund the closure costs on an\nexpedited basis and potentially lose revenues, which could have an\nadverse financial effect. In addition, there is a risk that claims may be\nmade arising from environmental remediation upon closure of one or\nmore of the sites.\n\n\n_Coal supply agreements_\nThe Company’s coal supply agreements typically require the delivery\nof a fixed or minimum quantity of coal at a location, at a time and\nover a period stipulated in the agreement. To the extent that any\ncontracted volumes cannot be delivered as agreed, the Company\nmay be liable to pay substantial compensation for the resulting losses,\ncosts and charges (including demurrage) incurred by the buyer.\n\n\nAs customer contracts expire, the Company will be likely to renew\ncontracts with long-term customers, or seek to enter into new\ncontracts with new buyers and markets, depending on the feasibility\nof this. Tonnes that are not contracted are sold into the spot market\nat either index-linked or fixed price levels. The Company’s strategy\nfor 2019 will be to increase its term contracted position as well as\nto target end-user customers as opposed to traders.\n\n\nMost of the Company’s coal supply agreements also require\nthe delivery of coal meeting specified quality thresholds for\ncharacteristics such as moisture content, sulphur content and ash\ncontent. Depending on these quality thresholds, coal will be sold into\nmarkets that are the highest paying for coal with the relevant qualities.\n\nThe Company derives a significant portion of its revenue from a limited\nnumber of customers, and the loss of, or a reduction in, sales to any\nof these customers could materially and adversely affect its business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\n\n\n_Joint ventures and reliance on third parties_\nThe Company holds a number of joint venture interests, including\ninterests in the Middlemount, Moolarben, HVO, Mount Thorley and\nWarkworth joint ventures, PWCS, NCIG and WICET, with other parties.\nDecision making, management, marketing and other key aspects of\neach joint venture are regulated by agreements between the relevant\njoint venture participants. Under these agreements, certain decisions\nrequire the endorsement of third party joint venture participants and\nthe Company relies on the co-operation of these third parties for the\nsuccess of its current operations and/or the development of its growth\nprojects and the transportation of increased production.\n\n\n\nThe Company cannot control the actions of third party joint venture\nparticipants, and therefore cannot guarantee that joint ventures will\nbe operated or managed in accordance with the preferred direction\nor strategy of the Company. There is a risk that the veto rights of,\nor consents required from, the joint venture partners will prevent the\nbusiness and assets of a joint venture from being developed, operated\nand managed in accordance with that preferred direction or strategy.\n\n\nThe Company also uses contractors and other third parties for\nexploration, mining and other services generally, and is reliant on\na number of third parties for the success of its current operations\nand for the development of its growth projects. While this is normal\nfor the mining and exploration industry, problems caused by third\nparties may arise which may have an impact on the performance and\noperations of the Company. Any failure by counterparties to perform\ntheir obligations may have a material adverse effect on the Company\nand there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful\nin attempting to enforce its contractual rights through legal action.\n\n\n_Competition_\nThe Company faces competition in all aspects of its business,\nincluding sales and marketing, pricing of coal, production capacity,\ncoal quality and specifications, transportation capacity, cost structure\nand brand recognition. The Company’s coal business competes in\nthe domestic and international markets with other large domestic and\ninternational coal producers. An increase in production or reduction\nin prices of competing coal from both Australia and overseas may\nadversely impact the Company’s ability to sell its coal products and\nthe price to be attained for sales. Increased competition in the future,\nincluding from new competitors, may emerge. This competition may\nrelate not only to coal produced and sold, but also to competition for\nthe acquisition of new projects, which may adversely affect the ability\nof the Company to acquire new interests on acceptable terms should\nit wish to make such acquisitions.\n\n\nFurther industry consolidation could result in competitors improving\ntheir scale or productivity or competitors may develop lower-cost\ngeological coal resources or develop resources in lower cost base\ngeographies, increasing pressure on the Company’s ability to maintain\nits margins.\n\nThere is significant competition within the resources industry in\nAustralia, the United States and Asia. Furthermore, new entrants\nto the industry may emerge in one or more of those markets,\nincreasing the competitive pressure on the Company. This pressure\ncould adversely affect the Company’s market share and financial\nperformance and position.\n\n\nThe Company supplies coal as fuel to, among others, the thermal\npower generation industry and, as a result, is affected by the demand\nand growth of the thermal power industry. Thermal coal as a fuel\nsource competes, among others, with natural gas, and the price of\nnatural gas can therefore affect coal sales. The natural gas market\nhas been volatile historically and prices in this market are subject to\nwide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply\nand demand. The thermal power generation industry is also affected\nby the development of alternative energy sources, climate change\nand global environmental factors.\n\n\n_Title risks_\n\nExploring or mining for coal is generally illegal without a tenement\ngranted by the State Governments. The grant and renewal of\ntenements is subject to a regulatory regime and each tenement\nis subject to certain conditions. There is no certainty that an\napplication for grant or renewal of a tenement will be granted at all\nor on satisfactory terms or within expected timeframes. Further, the\nconditions attached to tenements may change. The permitting rules\nare complex and may change over time, making the title holder’s\nresponsibility to comply with the applicable requirements more\nonerous, more costly or even impossible, thereby precluding or\nimpairing continuing or future mining operations. There is a risk that\nthe Company may lose title to any of its granted titles if it is unable\nto comply with conditions or if the land subject to the title is required\nfor public purposes. There is also a risk that a tenement may not\nbe granted from any applications for renewals of tenements or for\nnew tenements.\n\nObtaining mining tenements often involves first obtaining consents\nfrom landholders and other third parties, some of which may in\ncertain circumstances have a right of veto, as well as approvals\n(such as environmental approvals). There is a risk that the requisite\nconsents and approvals may not be able to be obtained on time\nor on acceptable commercial terms, or may not be able to be\nobtained at all, and consequently have an adverse financial effect\non the Company.\n\n\n_Native Title_\n\nIt is possible that, in relation to tenements which we have an interest in\nor will in the future acquire, there may be areas over which legitimate\nnative title rights of Aboriginal Australians may exist. Where the grant\nor renewal of a tenement is in respect of land in relation to which\nnative title may exist, the Company will need to comply with the _Native_\n_Title Act 1993_ (Cth) in order for the tenement to be validly granted.\n\n\nCompliance with the NTA (and the relevant native title process to\nbe followed for the grant of the tenement e.g. the right to negotiate\nprocess) may be prolonged or delayed, and substantial compensation\nmay be payable as part of any agreement reached, including for\nthe extinguishment or impairment of the relevant native title rights\nand interests.\n\n\nThe existence or determination of native title may, therefore, affect the\nexisting or future activities of the Company and impact on its ability\nto develop projects which may in turn impact its operational and\nfinancial performance.\n\n\nUnder the _Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983_ (NSW), Aboriginal Land\nCouncils can claim crown land if certain requirements are met. If a\nclaim is successful, freehold title over the relevant land is transferred\nto the claimant council. Further, Aboriginal Land Councils are\nafforded certain statutory rights which can include a requirement to\nenter into a compensation agreement prior to the grant of a Mining\nLease. This may delay the grant of future mining tenements over\nany area of such land. Some of our tenements are located in areas\nthat are subject to outstanding Aboriginal land claims, and additional\nAboriginal land claims may be made in the future over other areas\nin which our tenements are located. Any such claims may result in\nour ability to explore or mine for coal in these areas being subject to\nthe decisions of the relevant Aboriginal Land Councils, which may\nadversely affect our ability to develop projects and, consequently,\nour operational and financial performance.\n\n\n\n**CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT** ANNUAL REPORT 2018 **95**\n\n\n_Overlapping tenement risks_\nSome of the Company’s mines and associated tenements adjoin or\nare overlapped by petroleum tenements and adjoin other exploration\ninterests held by third parties. Overlapping tenements could potentially\nprevent, delay or increase the cost of the future development of\nthe Company’s projects because the Company and the relevant\npetroleum exploration licence or other exploration licence holders\ncould potentially seek to undertake their respective activities on the\noverlapping area or the same resource seams and in some cases\nthe overlapping petroleum tenure holder’s consent may be required.\n\n\nThere is no guarantee that agreement will be reached with the\noverlapping petroleum tenement holder or that agreement will not\nbe delayed or will be reached on terms satisfactory to the Company.\nThere is also a risk that if agreement cannot be reached with\noverlapping tenement holders the matter may be referred to the\nrelevant minister or a court who may make a decision which adversely\nimpacts upon or prevents the project proposed by the Company.\n\n\n_Enforcement and counterparty insolvency risks_\nThe Company has entered into contracts which are important to the\nfuture of its businesses including (but not limited to) for the provision\nof coal handling services, long-term sales contracts, debt facilities,\nlong-term leases, contract mining and the provision of certain\nguarantees, indemnities and sureties.\n\n\nAny failure by counterparties to perform those contracts may\nhave a material adverse effect on the Company and there can be\nno assurance that it would be successful in enforcing any of its\ncontractual rights through legal action.\n\n\nIn addition, any insolvency of a counterparty to any of these contracts\nmay have a material adverse effect on the Company and there can\nbe no assurance that it would be successful in enforcing any of its\ncontractual rights through legal action or recovering all monies owed\nby that counterparty (including under any claim for damages).\n\n\n_Coal royalties_\nRoyalties are payable to the NSW and QLD State Governments\non coal produced in NSW and QLD. In both States, the royalties\nare payable on an ad valorem basis as they are calculated as a\npercentage of the value for which the coal is sold. The relevant\nState Governments may increase these royalties or their method of\ncalculation. Any impost of new royalty related State tax or increase in\nroyalty rates may have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial\nposition and/or financial performance.\n\n\n_Climate change/carbon regulation risks_\nThe regulatory response to the risk of climate change, including\nunilateral and collective action by Australia and other countries,\nmay affect demand for coal, coal prices and the competitiveness\nof the Company’s products in the world energy market.\n\n\nIn November 2014, an agreement was announced between the\nUnited States and China to cut greenhouse gas emissions by more\nthan 25% below 2005 levels by 2025. This agreement was followed\nby the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, and the\nsigning of the Paris Agreement within the United Nationals Framework\nConvention on Climate Change. The Paris Agreement was signed\nby representatives from 195 countries, and aims to hold back the\nincrease in global temperatures, increase the ability of countries to\nadapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and provide channels\nto finance projects that lead to greenhouse gas reductions.\n\n\n**96** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\n\n\n**CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT** (CONTINUED)\n\n\n\nIn recent years, China has also taken steps to address severe air\npollution in many Chinese cities by adopting a range of policies to\nlower carbon emissions and reduce coal usage.\n\n\nExtensive government regulations relating to climate change impose\ncosts on the mining operations of the Company, and future regulations\ncould increase those costs, limit the Company’s ability to produce\nand sell coal, or reduce demand for the Company’s coal products.\n\n\n_Technological change_\nThermal coal as a source of energy competes with other forms of\nelectricity generation (such as hydro, solar and wind). In recent years,\nthe global shift from conventional fuels to renewable sources of energy\nhas created greater competition for thermal coal in the market.\n\nAs renewable technologies become more efficient and cost effective,\nthey may gain an economic advantage over coal-fired and other\nfossil fuel based electricity generation. These economic factors,\ncombined with increasing costs to comply with emission limits for\nother air pollutants, may result in the continued retirement of existing\ncoal-powered generation capacity, and the cancellation of planned\nadditional coal-fired power capacity, which may reduce demand for\nthermal coal in the market.\n\n\n_Technology_\nThe Company’s business relies on the performance, reliability and\navailability of its information technology systems. Information and\noperating technology may be subject to international cyber security\nthreats. Breaches could result in (but are not limited to) the loss of\nsensitive information, unplanned outage of business-critical systems,\nenvironmental damage and misappropriation of Company funds. The\nCompany’s information technology infrastructure in general may also\nbe adversely affected by factors such as server damage, equipment\nfaults, power failure, computer viruses, misuse by employees\nor contractors, telecommunications failures, external malicious\nintervention such as hacking, terrorism, fire, natural disasters, or\nweather interventions. Such events are largely beyond the Company’s\ncontrol, and may affect its ability to carry on its operations efficiently.\n\n\n_Key personnel_\nA number of key personnel are important to attaining the business\ngoals of the Company. One or more of these key employees could\nleave their employment or cease to actively participate in the\nmanagement of the Company and this may adversely affect the ability\nof the Company to conduct its business and, accordingly, affect its\nfinancial performance and its share price. There may be a limited\nnumber of persons with the requisite experience and skills to serve in\nthe Company’s senior management positions if existing management\nleave the Company. If the Company cannot attract, train and retain\nqualified managers, and other personnel, the Company may be\nunable to successfully manage its growth or otherwise compete\neffectively in the Australian coal industry.\n\nThe Company is also dependent on attracting qualified technical\nemployees to provide services in relation to certain of its coal and\nother mining operations. Coal mining is a labour-intensive industry.\nThe Company’s future success will depend greatly on its and its\nmining contractors’ continued ability to attract and retain skilled\nand qualified personnel on economic terms.\n\n\n_Fraud or misconduct_\n\nAny fraud, misrepresentation, money laundering or other misconduct\nby the Company’s employees, customers, service providers, business\npartners or other third parties could result in violations of relevant\nlaws and regulations by the Company and subject the Company to\ncorresponding regulatory sanctions. These unlawful activities and\nother misconduct may have occurred in the past and may occur in the\nfuture, and may result in civil and criminal liability under increasingly\n\n\n\nstringent laws or cause serious reputational or financial harm to the\nCompany. While the Company has in place and is implementing\nmeasures aimed at detecting and preventing employees’ and external\nparties’ fraud, misrepresentation, money laundering, commercial\nbribery and other misconduct, the Company may not be able to timely\ndetect or prevent such activities, which could subject the Company\nto regulatory investigations and criminal and civil liability, harm its\nreputation and have a material adverse effect on the Company’s\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\n\n_Environmental activism_\n\nEnvironmental lobby groups in both QLD and NSW have recently\nmade submissions opposing both operation and expansion of coal\nmines in an attempt to prevent new mine developments or expansion\nof existing mines on the basis of environmental concerns. Increased\ncommunity concern and adverse actions taken by community and\nenvironmental groups may delay or prevent the Company from\nprogressing new mine developments or development or expansion\nof existing mines, or may mean that those mines are subject to\nconditions that adversely affect their profitability and consequently\nthe financial performance of the Company.\n\n\n_Changes in government policy, regulation or legislation_\nThe resources industry is subject to extensive legislation,\nregulations and supervision by a number of Federal and State\nregulatory organisations.\n\n\nAny future legislation and regulatory change may affect the\nresources industry and may adversely affect the Company’s financial\nperformance and position, such as future laws that may limit the\nemission of greenhouse gases or the use of coal in power generation.\n\n\n_Environment and planning_\nIn recent years, State Government policies of NSW and QLD have\nbeen introduced in the interests of protecting agricultural and urban\nland from the effects of mining. These include the QLD Government’s\nCentral Queensland Plan and Regional Planning Interests Act and\nthe NSW Government’s Strategic Regional Land Use Policy, Aquifer\nInterference Policy, and 2013 amendments to the State Environmental\nPlanning Policy (Mining, Petroleum Production and Extractive\nIndustries) 2007. Each of these policies is relevant to the areas in\nwhich the Company has mining operations. Accordingly, there is no\nassurance that the future development and exploration activities of\nthe Company will result in profitable or commercially viable mining\noperations in these areas.\n\nIn 2013, the NSW State Government introduced the fit and proper\nperson consideration in making decisions about mining rights\nincluding the grant, transfer, renewal, cancellation and suspension\nof such rights. This allows the Government to consider a miner’s\nconduct (in particular its compliance with environmental and mining\nlegislation), as well as a miner’s financial capabilities and technical\nexpertise. In recent years, the NSW State Government has also\nsignificantly increased the maximum penalties for breaches of mining\nand environmental legislation, and the resources of regulators to\ninvestigate possible breaches and prosecute mining companies.\nThese changes have resulted in the updating of compliance\nprograms, and increased the risk of prosecution for breaches\nof relevant legislation.\n\n\nIn 2013, the QLD State Government reviewed the method of\ncalculating the financial assurance required to be provided by mining\ncompanies in respect of their rehabilitation liability and this review\nlead to a significant increase in financial assurance amounts that are\nrequired to be covered by bank guarantees. The Audit Office of NSW\nhas carried out a review of rehabilitation liabilities in respect of mines\nand the review has led to an increase in the amount of security\nrequired in respect of rehabilitation liabilities.\n\n\n_Litigation_\nLike all companies in the resources sector, the Company is exposed\nto the risks of litigation (either as the complainant or as the defendant),\nwhich may have a material adverse effect on the financial position of\nthe relevant entity. The Company could become exposed to claims or\nlitigation by persons alleging they are owed fees or other contractual\nentitlements, employees, regulators, competitors or other third\nparties. Such claims or proceedings could divert our management’s\ntime and attention and consume financial resources in their defence\nor prosecution.\n\n\n_Insurance_\n\nThe Company has insurance coverage for certain operating risks.\nHowever, it may become subject to liability (including in relation to\npollution, occupational illnesses or other hazards), or suffer loss\nresulting from business interruption, for which it is not insured\n(or has not sufficiently insured) or cannot insure, including liabilities\nin respect of past activities.\n\nShould a major uninsured loss be suffered, future financial\nperformance could be materially adversely affected. In addition,\ninsurance may not continue to be available at economically\nacceptable premiums. As a result, the insurance coverage may\nnot cover the full scope and extent of claims against the Company\nor losses it may incur, including, but not limited to, claims for\nenvironmental or industrial accidents, occupational illnesses, pollution\nand product liability, war, terrorism and business interruption.\n\n\nTo the extent a successful claim against the Company proceeds,\nit may have a material adverse effect on its financial position.\n\n\n_Exploration and development risks_\nThe Company’s existing coal reserves will decline as mining continues.\nTherefore, the Company’s growth and long-term success will depend\non its ability to acquire additional coal resources within its exploration\nareas and to convert such coal resources into economically\nrecoverable coal reserves.\n\n\nThere are several risks relating to coal mining exploration and\ndevelopment which are common to the industry and which, if realised,\nhave the capacity to affect the operations, production, cash flow and\nfinancial performance of the Company.\n\n\nDevelopment and exploration activities may be affected by factors\nbeyond the control of the Company, including geological conditions,\nseismic activity, mineralisation, consistency and predictability of coal\ngrades, changes to law, changes to the regulatory framework applying\nto mining, overlapping resources tenure, and the rights of indigenous\npeople on whose land exploration activities are undertaken.\n\n\nAny discovery of a coal deposit does not guarantee that the mining of\nthat deposit would be commercially viable, with the size of the deposit,\ndevelopment and operating costs, land ownership, coal prices and\nrecovery rates all being key factors in determining commercial viability.\n\n\nIssues that arise during development, construction and mine startup may result in increased costs, delayed commencement of coal\nproduction, delayed receipt of coal revenue or coal production not\ncommencing at all. These problems may include delays in obtaining\napprovals (including land use approvals) or in the construction of mine\ninfrastructure. There are many milestones which need to be met in a\ntimely fashion for production to commence on any projects currently\nin the pre-development or development stages.\n\n\nThe Company may also be exposed to risks including risks of default\nassociated with managing contractual relationships with participants\nin any of the development or exploration joint ventures or other\ncontractual relationships to which it is, or may become, a party.\n\n\n\n**CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT** ANNUAL REPORT 2018 **97**\n\n\n_Transport and infrastructure_\nCoal produced from the Company’s mining operations is transported\nto customers by a combination of road, rail and sea. Fluctuations in\ntransportation costs and disruptions to our railway and port linkages\ncould disrupt the Company’s coal deliveries and adversely affect its\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\nA number of factors could disrupt or restrict access to essential coal\ntransportation and handling services, including (but not limited to):\n\n\n–– weather related problems;\n\n\n–– key equipment and infrastructure failures;\n\n\n–– rail or port capacity constraints;\n\n\n–– congestions and inter-system losses;\n\n\n–– industrial action;\n\n\n–– failure to obtain consents from third parties for access to rail\nor land;\n\n\n–– failure or delay in the construction of new rail or port capacity;\n\n\n–– failure to meet contractual requirements;\n\n\n–– access is removed or not granted by regulatory authority;\n\n\n–– terrorist attacks or other similar events;\n\n\n–– breach of regulatory framework;\n\n\n–– mismatch of below rail capacity, above rail capacity and port\ncapacity; and\n\n\n–– possible sale of infrastructure,\n\n\nall or any of which could impair the Company’s ability to supply coal\nto customers and/or increase costs, and consequently may have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company’s financial position.\n\nSignificant increases in transport costs (such as emissions control\nrequirements and fluctuations in the price of diesel fuel and\ndemurrage) could make the Company’s coal less competitive when\ncompared to other fuels or coal produced from other regions.\n\n\n_Environmental risks_\n\nDue to the nature of coal mining processes, and the associated\nby-products, residues and tailings generated from these processes,\nall operations of the Company are subject to stringent environmental\nlaws and regulations.\n\n\nThere is a risk that past, present or future operations have not met\nor will not meet environmental or related regulatory requirements\nand/or that the approvals or modifications the Company is currently\nseeking, or may need to seek in the future, will not be granted. If\nthe Company is unsuccessful in these efforts or otherwise breaches\nthese environmental requirements, it may incur fines or penalties, be\nrequired to curtail or cease operations and/or be subject to increased\ncompliance costs or costs for rehabilitation or rectification works,\nwhich have not been previously planned at one or more of its sites.\n\n\nExtensive environmental regulations in Australia, and in other countries\nthat could affect the Company’s business, may impose costs on its\nmining operations, and future regulations could increase those costs,\nlimit its ability to produce and sell coal, or reduce demand for the\nCompany’s our coal products. In particular, the regulatory response to\nthe risk of climate change, including unilateral and collective action by\nAustralia and other countries, may affect demand for coal, coal prices\nand the competitiveness of the Company’s products in the world\nenergy market in the medium to long term.\n\n\n**98** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\n\n\n**CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT** (CONTINUED)\n\n\n\nChanges in and future environmental regulations could increase\nthe standards and costs of compliance, and adversely affect the\nCompany’s ability to generate the expected economic returns from\nits mining assets over their useful lives. The Company may not\nalways be able to comply with future laws and regulations in relation\nto environmental protection economically or at all. There can be no\nassurance that the Company will be able to fully and economically\nutilise the entire coal resources of the mines it operates currently or in\nthe future or that some of its mining assets will not become “stranded\nassets” that are not able to generate the expected economic returns\nover their useful lives.\n\n\nEnvironmental legislation may change in a manner that may require\ncompliance with additional standards, and a heightened degree of\nresponsibility for companies and their directors and employees. There\nmay also be unforeseen environmental liabilities resulting from coal\nrelated activities, which may be costly to remedy. In particular, the\nacceptable level of pollution and the potential abandonment costs\nand obligations for which the Company may become liable as a\nresult of its activities may be impossible to assess under the current\nlegal framework.\n\n\n_Health, safety and hazardous materials risks_\nThe Company‘s operations may substantially impact the environment\nor cause exposure to hazardous materials. It will use hazardous\nmaterials and will generate hazardous waste, and may be subject to\ncommon law claims, damages due to natural disasters, and other\ndamages, as well as the investigation and clean-up of soil, surface\nwater, groundwater, and other media. Such claims may arise, for\nexample, out of current or former activities at sites that it owns\nor operates.\n\n\nThere is also a risk that actions could be brought against the\nCompany, alleging adverse effects of such substances on personal\nhealth. If any injuries or accidents occur in a mine, this could have\nadverse financial implications including legal claims for personal injury,\nwrongful death, amendments to approvals, potential production\ndelays or stoppages, any of which may have a material adverse effect\non the financial performance and/or financial position of the Company.\n\n\nThere is a risk that past, present or future operations have not met,\nor will not meet, health and safety requirements and/or that the\napprovals or modifications the Company is currently seeking, or\nmay need to seek in the future, will not be granted at all or on terms\nthat are unduly onerous. If the Company is unsuccessful in these\nefforts or otherwise breaches these health and safety requirements,\nit may incur fines or penalties, be required to curtail or cease\noperations and/or be subject to increased compliance costs or\ncosts for rehabilitation or rectification works, which have not been\npreviously planned, at one or more of its sites.\n\n\n_Impairment risks_\nThe Company’s balance sheet includes a number of assets that are\nsubject to impairment risk, including mining tenements, exploration\nand evaluation assets, goodwill, the Middlemount loan and royalty\nreceivable, the Watagan loan receivable and investments accounted\nfor using the equity method.\n\n\nThe value of these assets is derived from the fundamental valuation\nof the underlying mining operations and as such is subject to many of\nthe risks including, but not limited to, coal price and demand, foreign\nexchange, coal production, estimates of reserves and resources,\nuncertainty in costs forecasts, operating risks, injury and mine closure.\n\n\nAdverse changes in these risk factors could lead to a reduction in the\nvaluation of the Company’s assets and result in an impairment charge\nbeing recognised.\n\n\n\nInternal audit function\n\nThe internal audit function is managed by the GM of Risk and\nAssurance. That person has direct access to the Chair of the Audit\nand Risk Management Committee, as well as to the CEC, to whom\nhe directly reports. The CEC and the Audit and Risk Management\nCommittee recommend to the Board the appointment of the GM\nof Risk and Assurance.\n\n\nThe GM of Risk and Assurance has unfettered access to the Audit\nand Risk Management Committee and its Chair to seek information\nand explanations. The Chair of the Audit and Risk Management\nCommittee meets independently with the GM Risk and Assurance.\n\n\nThe role of the GM Risk and Assurance includes achievement\nof the internal audit objectives, risk management policies and\ninsurance strategy.\n\n\nAn annual program for internal audit and risk assurance is provided\nto the Audit and Risk Management Committee for approval. The\nannual Internal Audit program is focused on key operating risks and\nprocesses, control design and operating effectiveness.\n\n\nThe program includes a review of compliance with the obligations\nimposed by the General Rules on Internal Control for Enterprises and\nthe Supporting Guidelines of Internal Control for Enterprises, jointly\nissued by five Chinese ministries.\n\n\nPeriodical status reports on the execution of the plan, including\ncurrent findings and actions, are provided to the Audit and Risk\nManagement Committee. This includes key issues and subsequently\ncorrective actions are monitored, reviewed and reported. Any material\nfindings are reported to the Board.\n\n\nHealth, Safety and Environment Compliance\nThe Company has adopted policies to comply with occupational\nhealth, safety, environment and other laws. The Board has a Health,\nSafety and Environment Policy in place since May 2016 which applies\nacross the Company. In addition, each mine site has its own health,\nsafety and environmental policies and procedures to deal with their\nparticular health, safety and environmental issues. The Board has\nestablished a Health, Safety and Environment Committee to assist\nit in overseeing the Company’s health, safety and environmental\nresponsibilities. In accordance with its charter, which was reviewed\nand amended in October 2018 to provide for relevant provisions\nof the HK Listing Rules, this committee has a minimum of at least\nthree members. The current members of this committee are David\nMoult (appointed 6 February 2018) (Chair of the committee), Geoffrey\nRaby, Fuqi Wang and Fucun Wang (appointed 8 June 2018). Vincent\nO’Rourke resigned as Chair of the committee on 30 January 2018.\nIt is intended the committee meets at least four times per year, or as\nfrequently as required. The committee meetings are held at one of the\nCompany’s mine sites, whenever possible, to receive feedback from\nthe health, safety and environment forum held at the mine site and to\naddress any mine-specific health, safety and environment issues.\n\n\n**Principle 8: Remunerate fairly and responsibly**\n\nNomination and Remuneration Committee\n\nThe Board has established a Nomination and Remuneration\nCommittee. In accordance with its charter, which was reviewed and\namended in October 2018 to provide for relevant provisions of the\nHK Listing Rules, this committee currently has five members, Helen\nGillies (appointed 8 June 2018) (Chair of the committee, member since\n6 February 2018), Xiangqian Wu and Gregory Fletcher (appointed\n8 June 2018), Baocai Zhang (appointed 8 June 2018) and David Moult\n(appointed 8 June 2018). Xiyong Li resigned as the Chair on 8 June\n2018 and Cunliang Lai resigned as a member of the committee on\n8 June 2018. Three of the members of the committee, including the\nChair of the committee, are independent Directors of the Company,\nin line with the ASX Recommendations. The Nomination and\nRemuneration Committee Charter can be found within the Corporate\nGovernance section of the Company’s website.\n\n\nThe committee makes recommendations to the Board to achieve\nCompany remuneration structures that are equitable and aligned with\nthe long-term interests of the Company and its shareholders, to attract\nand retain skilled employees, to structure short- and long-term\nincentives that are challenging and linked to creation of sustainable\nreturns and to ensure any termination benefits are justifiable\nand appropriate.\n\nIn 2018, the committee engaged consulting firm Aon Hewitt ( **Aon** )\nto provide independent market benchmarking with respect to the\nremuneration of Yancoal Executives and Non-Executive Directors.\nAon presented its recommendations to the committee in Q1 and Q2\n2018, which were endorsed by the committee for Board approval.\nThe Board adopted the recommendations in May 2018.\n\n\nThe committee has the necessary power and resources to meet\nits responsibilities under its charter, including rights of access to\nmanagement, auditors and external advisors. It is intended that\nthe committee will meet at least once per year, or as frequently\nas required.\n\n\nRemuneration of Non-Executive Directors\n\nThe Constitution provides that the Non-Executive Directors are entitled\nto such remuneration as approved by the Company’s shareholders\nin accordance with the Constitution, which must not exceed the\naggregate annual amount as determined by the Company in general\nmeeting or by its major shareholder, Yanzhou.\n\n\nRemuneration for Non-Executive Directors is capped at an aggregate\namount for each financial year of $3.5 million. Non-Executive\nDirectors may also be paid such additional or special remuneration\nas the Directors decide is appropriate where a Non-Executive\nDirector performs extra services or makes special exertions for\nthe benefit of the Company. Such additional remuneration will not\nform part of the calculation of the aggregate cap on Non-Executive\nDirectors’ remuneration for a financial year and does not require\nshareholder approval. No Director is involved in determining his\nor her own remuneration.\n\n\nFurther details of the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors,\nExecutive Directors and senior Executives can be found in the\nRemuneration Report on pages 64 to 77.\n\n\n\n**CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT** ANNUAL REPORT 2018 **99**\n\n\nDealings in Company securities\nBy law, and under the Company’s Insider Trading Policy, dealing in\nCompany securities is subject to the overriding prohibition on trading\nwhile in possession of inside information.\n\n\nIn addition, the Company’s Share Trading Policy prohibits dealing\nin Company securities or Yanzhou securities by Directors, senior\nExecutives and other relevant employees, as well as their closely\nrelated parties, during specified blackout periods each year. General\nemployees are permitted to deal in Company securities outside these\nblackout periods; however additional approval requirements apply to\nDirectors, the CEO and the CFO. The Share Trading Policy precludes\nrelevant employees from entering into any hedge or derivative\ntransactions relating to unvested options or share rights granted to\nthem under incentive plans and securities that are subject to holding\nlocks or restrictions on dealing under such plans. There are also\nrestrictions that apply to relevant employees from entering into margin\nlending arrangements and short-term trading of the Company’s\nsecurities. Breaches of the policy are treated seriously and may lead to\ndisciplinary action, including dismissal.\n\n\nThe Board approved revisions to its share trading policy in October\n2018 with the requirements set out in the Model Code for Securities\nTransactions by Directors of Listed Issuers (the **Model Code** ) as set\nout in Appendix 10 of the HK Listing Rules to regulate the Directors’\nsecurities transactions, which is also applicable to the Company’s\nemployees who are likely to be in possession of unpublished\ninside information.\n\nSpecific enquiry has been made of all the Directors and they have\neach confirmed that they have complied with the Company’s Share\nTrading Policy and Insider Trading Policy (which is more stringent than\nthe Model Code) since the HK Listing (on 6 December 2018) to 31\nDecember 2018.\n\n\nCopies of the Company’s Share Trading Policy and Insider Trading\nPolicy are available on the Corporate Governance section of the\nCompany’s website.\n\n\nThis Corporate Governance Statement has been approved by the\nBoard and is current as at 25 February 2019.\n\n\n**100** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD **FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n\n**CONSOLIDATED

PREPARATION**\n\n\nThese consolidated financial statements and notes are for\nthe consolidated entity consisting of Yancoal Australia Ltd\n(“Company” or “parent entity”) and its subsidiaries (“the Group”).\n\nThese general purpose financial statements have been prepared\nin accordance with the Australian Accounting Standards and\ninterpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board\nand the Corporations Act 2001. Yancoal Australia Ltd is a for-profit\nentity for the purpose of preparing the financial statements.\n\nThe financial statements were authorised for issue in accordance\nwith a resolution of the Directors on 25 February 2019.\n\n\n_(i) Compliance with IFRS_\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group also comply\nwith International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued\nby the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”).\n\n\n_(ii) Subsidiaries_\nThe Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has\nrights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has\nthe ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.\n\n\nSubsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control\nis transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date\nthat control ceases.\n\n\nThe acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business\ncombinations by the Group. Intercompany transactions, balances\nand unrealised gains on transactions between the Group companies\nare eliminated.\n\n\nUnrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides\nevidence of the impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting\npolicies of subsidiaries are aligned to ensure consistency with the\npolicies adopted by the Group.\n\n\n_(iii) Significant accounting policies_\nSignificant accounting policies have been included in the\nrelevant notes to which the policies relate, and other significant\naccounting policies are discussed in Note F6. These policies\nhave been consistently applied to all the years presented,\nunless otherwise stated.\n\n\n_(iv) Historical cost convention_\nThese financial statements have been prepared on an accrual\nbasis and under the historical cost convention, as modified by the\nrevaluation of available for sale financial assets and financial assets\nand liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through\nprofit or loss.\n\n\n_(v) Auditor sign-off – unqualified and unmodified_\nThe independent auditor’s report of these consolidated financial\nstatements is unqualified and unmodified. Refer to page 172 for\nfurther details.\n\n\n\n_(vi) Rounding of amounts_\nThe Company is of a kind referred to in ASIC Legislative Instrument\n2016/191, issued by the Australian Securities and Investments\nCommission, relating to the “rounding off” of amounts in the financial\nstatements. Amounts in the financial statements have been rounded\noff in accordance with that legislative instrument to the nearest million\ndollars, or in certain cases, the nearest dollar.\n\n\n_(vii) New and amended standards adopted by the Group_\nEffective from 1 January 2018 the Group adopted new standards\nincluding AASB 9 _Financial Instruments_ and AASB 15 _Revenue from_\n_Contracts with Customers_ . Refer to Note F7 for details.\n\n\n_(viii) Impact of standards issued but not yet applied by the Group_\nAustralian Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued but not\nyet applicable for the year ended 31 December 2018 that have not\nbeen applied by the Group are disclosed in Note F8.\n\n\n_(ix) Early adoption of standards_\nCertain new accounting standards and interpretations have been\npublished that are not mandatory for 31 December 2018 reporting\nperiods and have not been early adopted by the Group. The Group’s\nassessment of the impact of these new standards and interpretations\nis set out in Note F8.\n\n\n_(x) Critical accounting estimates and judgements_\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the use of certain\ncritical accounting estimates and judgements that involve a higher\ndegree of judgement or complexity. It also requires management\nto exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s\naccounting policies.\n\n\nThe Directors evaluate estimates and judgements incorporated\ninto these financial statements based on historical knowledge and\nbest available current information. Estimates assume a reasonable\nexpectation of future events and are based on current trends and\neconomic data, obtained both externally and within the Company.\nThe resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal\nthe related actual results.\n\n\nDetails of critical accounting estimates and judgements can be found\nin the notes to which they relate and include:\n\n\nTaxation Note B6\n\nMining tenements Note C2\nImpairment of assets Note C3\n\nExploration and evaluation assets Note C4\n\nRoyalty receivable Note C9\n\nProvisions Note C11\n\nBusiness combinations and disposals Note E1\nControl of Watagan Note E2\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** ANNUAL REPORT 2018 **105**\n\n\n**B – PERFORMANCE**\n\n\nThis section of the financial statements focuses on disclosure that enhances a user’s understanding of profit after tax. Segment reporting\nprovides a breakdown of profit, revenue and assets by geographic segment. The key line items of the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other\nComprehensive Income along with their components provide details behind the reported balances.\n\n\n**B1 SEGMENT INFORMATION**\n\n\n**Accounting Policy**\nManagement has determined the operating segments based on the strategic direction and organisational structure of the Group together\nwith reports reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Makers (“CODM”), defined as the Executive Committee, that are used to make\nstrategic decisions including resource allocation and assessment of segment performance.\n\n\nThe reportable segments are considered at a regional level being New South Wales (“NSW”) and Queensland (“QLD”).\n\n\nNon-operating items of the Group are presented under the segment “Corporate” which includes administrative expenses, foreign exchange\ngains and losses recycled from hedge reserve, and the elimination of intersegment transactions and other consolidation adjustments.\n\n\n**(a) Segment information**\nThe segment information for the reportable segments for the year ended 31 December 2018 is as follows:\n\n\n**Coal Mining**\n\n\n\n**Corporate**\n\n\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Total**\n\n\n\n**QLD**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**31 December 2018**\n\n\n\n**NSW** **QLD** **Corporate** **Total**\n\n**$M** **$M** **$M** **$M**\n\n\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\nTotal segment revenue* 4,294 446 (160) 4,580\n\nAdd: Fair value losses recycled from hedge reserve – – 160 160\n\n**Revenue from external customers** **4,294** **446** **–** **4,740**\n\n\nOperating EBIT 1,698 95 (136) 1,657\nOperating EBITDA 2,183 127 (130) 2,180\n\n\n**Material income or expense items**\n\n\n**Non-cash items**\n\nRemeasurement of royalty receivable – – 4 4\n\nDepreciation and amortisation expense (483) (33) (7) (523)\n\nGain on disposal of joint operation and subsidiaries – – 78 78\n\nTransaction costs – – (11) (11)\n\nStamp duty accrued – – 4 4\n\n– –\nImpairment of financial assets (21) (21)\nRemeasurement of financial assets – – (29) (29)\n**483** **33** **(18)** **498**\n\n\n**Cash items**\n\nTransaction costs – – (18) (18)\n\nStamp duty paid – – (30) (30)\n\n**–** **–** **48** **48**\n\n\n**Total capital expenditure** **200** **10** **–** **210**\n\n\nSegment assets 9,793 794 452 11,039\n\nDeferred tax assets 113 18 931 1,062\n\nInvestment in associate and joint venture 191 – 116 307\n\n**Total assets** **10,097** **812** **1,499** **12,408**\n\n\n**106** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** (CONTINUED)\n\n\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018\n\n\n**B – PERFORMANCE**\n\n\n**B1 SEGMENT INFORMATION (CONTINUED)**\n\n\n**(a) Segment information (continued)**\nThe segment information for the reportable segments for the year ended 31 December 2017 is as follows:\n\n\n**Coal Mining**\n\n\n\n**Corporate**\n\n\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Total**\n\n\n\n**QLD**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**31 December 2017**\n\n\n\n**NSW** **QLD** **Corporate** **Total**\n\n**$M** **$M** **$M** **$M**\n\n\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\nTotal segment revenue* 2,163 460 (229) 2,394\n\nAdd: Fair value losses recycled from hedge reserve – – 229 229\n\n**Revenue from external customers** **2,163** **460** **–** **2,623**\n\n\nOperating EBIT 682 92 (42) 732\nOperating EBITDA 898 126 (36) 988\n\n\n**Material income or expense items**\n\n\n**Non-cash items**\n\nRemeasurement of royalty receivable – – 8 8\n\nDepreciation and amortisation expense (215) (35) (6) (256)\n\nGain on acquisition of subsidiaries – – 177 177\n\nTransaction costs – – (16) (16)\n\n– –\nStamp duty accrued (19) (19)\n\nImpairment reversal of mining tenements 100 – – 100\n**115** **35** **(144)** **6**\n\n\n**Cash items**\n\nTransaction costs – – (17) (17)\n\nStamp duty paid – – (148) (148)\n\n**–** **–** **(165)** **(165)**\n\n\n**Total capital expenditure** **335** **4** **1** **340**\n\n\nSegment assets 8,793 714 1,336 10,843\n\nDeferred tax assets 182 24 1,013 1,219\n\nInvestment in associate and joint venture 191 – 60 251\n\n**Total assets** **9,166** **738** **2,409** **12,313**\n\n\n- Total segment revenue consists of revenue from the sale of coal whereas revenue disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income\nalso includes other revenue such as management fees, sea freight, rents and sub-lease rentals, interest income, dividend income and royalty income.

Furthermore, the measure excludes the effects of fair value re-measurements\nand foreign exchange gains/(losses) on interest-bearing liabilities. Interest income and expense are not allocated to the NSW and QLD\nsegments, as this type of activity is driven by the corporate function, which manages the cash position of the Group.\n\nA reconciliation of Operating EBITDA to profit before income tax from continuing operations is provided as follows:\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n\n**2018**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n\n**2017**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Operating EBITDA** **2,180** 988\nDepreciation and amortisation **(523)** (256)\n\n\n**Operating EBIT** **1,657** 732\n\nInterest income **119** 114\n\nFinance costs **(293)** (287)\nBank fees and other charges **(96)** (109)\nGain on disposal of interest in joint operation and subsidiaries **78** –\n\nGain on acquisition of subsidiaries **–** 177\nImpairment reversal of mining tenements (refer to Note C3(b)) **–** 100\nStamp duty **(25)** (167)\nFair value losses recycled from hedge reserve – USD loans **(160)** (229)\nTransaction costs **(29)** (33)\n\n–\nRemeasurement of financial assets **(29)**\n\n–\nRemeasurement of contingent royalty **(33)**\n\n–\nImpairment of financial assets **(21)**\n\nRemeasurement of royalty receivable **4** 8\n\nReceipts from joint venture participant **–** 5\n**Profit before income tax from continuing operations** **1,172** 311\n\n\n(iii) Segment capitalised expenditure\nAmounts with respect to capital expenditure are measured in a manner consistent with that of the financial statements.

Revenue is measured at the amount\nof consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring control of products or services to the customer.\nAmounts disclosed as revenue are net of returns, trade allowances, rebates and amounts collected on behalf of third parties.\n\nDescriptions of the Group’s performance obligations in contracts with customers and significant judgements applied in revenue recognition\nare as follows:\n\n\n**(a) Sales revenue**\n(i) Sale of coal\nThe Group produces and sells a range of thermal and metallurgical coal products. Revenue from the sale of coal is recognised when control\nof the product has transferred to the customer. Control of the product is considered transferred to the customer at the time of delivery,\nusually on a Free On Board (“FOB”) basis or a Cost and Freight (“CFR”) basis. For CFR contracts the performance obligation relating to\nfreight services is accounted for as a separate performance obligation. On occasion revenue from the sale of coal is recognised as the ship\npulls into harbour on a Free Alongside Ship (“FAS”) basis or from the stockpile on an ex-works basis.\n\n\nA receivable is recognised when control of the products is delivered as this is the point in time that the consideration is unconditional and\nonly the passage of time is required before the payment is due. Payment of the transaction price is usually due within 21 days of the date\nwhen control of the product is transferred to the customer. From time to time, the Group receives prepayments before control of the product\nhas transferred to the customer. Such prepayments are recognised as contract liabilities.\n\n\nSome of the Group’s coal sales contracts are long-term supply agreements which stipulate the nominal annual quantity and price\nnegotiation mechanism. For those contracts, the actual quantity and transaction price applicable for future shipments are only negotiated\nor determined prior to the beginning of, or a date which is after, each contract year or delivery period. The transaction price for a future\nshipment is based on, or derived from, a market price prevailing at the time of the future shipment. As the future market price for coal is\nhighly susceptible to factors outside the Group’s influence, the transaction price for a shipment is not readily determinable until or nearing\nthe time of the shipment. As a result, the Group has concluded that a contract with the customer does not exist for those shipments for\nwhich the actual delivery quantity and transaction price have not yet been negotiated or determined.\n\n\nThe transaction price for a shipment is often linked to a market index for the respective delivery period. For example, the transaction price\nmay be determined by reference to the average GlobalCOAL Newcastle Index for the delivery period. At the end of each reporting period,\nthe final average index price may not be available for certain shipments. In those situations, the Group uses “the expected value” method\nto estimate the amount of variable consideration based on the most recent average index price available for the relevant delivery period as\nof the end of the reporting periods and for those shipments, the Group has determined that a significant reversal in the amount of revenue\nrecognised will not occur.\n\n\n**(b) Other revenue**\n(i) Interest\nInterest income from a financial asset is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate\napplicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that\nasset’s net carrying amount. Interest income from a finance lease is recognised over the term of the lease based on a pattern reflecting a\nconstant periodic rate of return on the net investment in the lease.\n\n\n(ii) Mining services fees\nThe Group provides corporate support services, IT services and mining services which relate to the management of mines. The management\nand mining service agreements stipulate a fixed monthly service fee and payment of the service fees is usually due within 21 days after the\nend of each calendar month in which the service is rendered. Revenue from providing management and mining services is recognised in\neach month in which the services are rendered.\n\n\n(iii) Sea freight services\nWhen contracts for sale of coal include freight on a CFR basis the performance obligation associated with providing the shipping is\nseparately measured and recognised as the service is provided.\n\n\n(iv) Other\nOther primarily consists of dividends, rents, sub-lease rental and management fees. Dividends are recognised as revenue when the right to\nreceive payment is established, it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the Group and the amount\nof the dividend can be measured reliably. Rental income arising on land surrounding a mine site is accounted for on a straight-line basis over\nthe lease term. Contingent rental income is recognised as income in the periods in which it is earned.\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** ANNUAL REPORT 2018 **109**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n\n**2018**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Restated**\n\n**31 December**\n\n\n**2017**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**From continuing operations**\n\n_Sales revenue_\n\nSale of coal **4,740** 2,623\n\nFair value losses recycled from hedge reserve **(160)** (229)\n\n**4,580** 2,394\n\n\n_Other revenue_\n\nInterest income **119** 114\n\nMining services fees **46** 52\nSea freight **66** 12\n\nOther **39** 29\n\n**270** 207\n\n**4,850** 2,601\n\n\n**Disaggregation of revenue**\nIn the following table, revenue is disaggregated by primary geographical market and major products/service lines.

Employee benefits recognised in the profit or loss are net of recoveries.\n\n\n(ii) Superannuation\nContributions made by the Group under Australian legislation to contribute 9.5% of employees’ salaries and wages to the employees’\ndefined contribution superannuation funds are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.\n\n\n(iii) Wages and salaries, annual leave and sick leave\nLiabilities for employee benefits for wages, salaries, annual leave and accumulating sick leave that are expected to be wholly settled within\n12 months of the reporting date represent present obligations resulting from employees’ services provided to the reporting date and are\ncalculated at undiscounted amounts based on wage and salary rates that the Group expects to pay as at the reporting date including\nrelated on-costs, such as superannuation, workers’ compensation, insurance and payroll tax and are included in trade and other payables.\nNon-accumulating, non-monetary benefits such as housing and cars are expensed by the Group as the benefits are used by the employee.\n\nEmployee benefits payable later than 12 months have been measured at the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be\nmade for those benefits. In determining the liability, consideration is given to employee salary and wage increases and the probability that\nthe employee may satisfy any vesting requirements. Those cash flows are discounted using corporate bonds with terms to maturity that\nmatch the expected timing of cash flows attributable to employee benefits.\n\n\nAdditional Long Service Leave payments are made monthly to the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Corporation\nbased on the eligible monthly payroll of employees involved in the mining of black coal. Reimbursement is sought from the fund when long\nservice leave is paid to employees involved in the mining of black coal. An asset for the amount recoverable from the Coal Mining Industry\n(Long Service Leave Funding) Corporation is recognised in trade and other receivables.\n\nThese employee benefits are presented as current provisions as the Group has no unconditional right to deferred settlement for at least\n12 months after the end of the reporting period.\n\n\n(iv) Equity-settled share-based payments\nThe grant date fair value of equity-settled share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognised as an expense, with a\ncorresponding increase in equity, over the vesting period of the awards. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect\nthe number of awards for which related service and non-market performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount\nultimately recognised is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the\nvesting date. For share-based payment awards with market performance conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based payment\nis measured using a Black-Scholes option pricing model to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected\nand actual outcomes.\n\n\n**(a) Employee benefits**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n\n**2018**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n\n**2017**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\nEmployee benefits **464** 281\nShare-based payments **16** –\n\nSuperannuation contributions **38** 21\nTotal employee benefits **518** 302\n\n\nDuring 2018 $1 million of employee benefits were capitalised (2017: $17 million).\n\n\n**(b) Key Management Personnel compensation**\nRefer to the Remuneration Report contained in the Directors’ Report for details of the remuneration paid or payable to each member of the\nGroup’s Key Management Personnel (“KMP”) for the year ended 31 December 2018.\n\n\nThe total of remuneration paid to KMP of the Company and the Group during the year was as follows:\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n\n**2018**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n\n**2017**\n\n\n\nShort-term employee benefits **5,901,640** 9,265,818\nPost-employment benefits **149,534** 149,362\nOther long-term benefits **2,742,559** 1,950,142\n\n**8,793,733** 11,365,322\n\n\n**112** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** (CONTINUED)\n\n\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018\n\n\n**B – PERFORMANCE**\n\n\n**B4 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (CONTINUED)**\n\n**(c) Top five employees**\nThe five highest paid individuals in the Group include one Director (2017 only), and the Chief Executive for each of the years, and details of\nwhose remuneration are set out in the Remuneration Report.

However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for if it\narises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction\naffects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted\nor substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is\nrealised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.\n\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable\namounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses. The carrying value of the deferred tax asset is reviewed at each\nreporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that future taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the\nasset to be recovered.\n\n\nDeferred tax liabilities and assets are recognised for taxable temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax bases of\ninvestments in controlled entities, except where the parent entity is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences\nand it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when the\ndeferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally\nenforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\nCurrent and deferred tax is recognised in the profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive\nincome or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.\n\n\n**Tax consolidation legislation**\nYancoal Australia Ltd and its wholly owned Australian controlled entities have implemented the tax consolidation legislation for income tax\npurposes. The accounting policy in relation to this legislation is set out in Note E4.\n\n\n**Critical accounting estimates and judgements**\nThe Group is subject to income taxes in Australia. Significant judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes.\nDeferred tax assets, including those arising from unutilised tax losses, require the Group to assess the likelihood that the Group will generate\nsufficient taxable earnings in future periods, in order to utilise recognised deferred tax assets. Judgement is also required in respect of\nthe application of existing tax laws especially in relation to position adopted that may have an uncertain outcome. Assumptions about the\ngeneration of future taxable profits depend on management’s estimates of future cash flows. These estimates of future taxable income are\nbased on forecast cash flows from operations (which are impacted by production and sales volumes, coal prices, reserves, operating costs,\nclosure and rehabilitation costs, capital expenditure, and other capital management transactions). To the extent that future cash flows and\ntaxable income differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the Group to realise the net deferred tax assets recorded at the reporting date\ncould be impacted. In addition, future changes in tax laws could limit the ability of the Group to obtain tax deductions in future periods.\n\n\n**(a) Income tax expense**\n(i) Net tax expenses\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n\n**2018**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n\n**2017**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\nIncome tax expense **(340)** (84)\n\nIncome tax over provision in respect of prior years **20** 2\n**(320)** (82)\n\n\nNet tax expense is attributable to:\nContinuing operations **(320)** (82)\n\n\n**114** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** (CONTINUED)\n\n\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018\n\n\n**B – PERFORMANCE**\n\n\n**B6 TAXATION (CONTINUED)**\n\n\n**(a) Income tax expense (continued)**\n(ii) Income tax expense\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n\n**2018**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n\n**2017**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\nDeferred tax expense **(320)** (82)\nDeferred tax expense included in income tax benefit comprises:\n\nNet over provision in respect of prior years **20** 2\nDecrease in deferred tax assets (refer to Note B6(b)(ii)) **(301)** (34)\nIncrease in deferred tax liabilities (refer to Note B6(c)(ii)) **(39)** (50)\n**(320)** (82)\n\n\n(iii) Reconciliation of income tax expense to prima facie tax payable\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n\n**2018**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n\n**2017**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\nProfit from continuing operations before tax **1,172** 311\nTax at the Australian tax rate of 30% (2017 – 30%) **(352)** (95)\nTax effect of amounts which are not deductible/taxable in calculating taxable income:\nOver provision in prior years **20** 2\nMovements in financial assets **(15)** (1)\nStamp duty expensed **(7)** (50)\nShare of profit of equity-accounted investees not deductible **16** 10\nGain on acquisition of subsidiaries **–** 53\n\nGain on disposal of interest in joint operation **14** –\n\nDenial of debt deductions **–** (1)\n\nOther **4** –\n\nIncome tax expense **(320)** (82)\n\n\n(iv) Amounts recognised directly in equity\n\nAggregate current and deferred tax arising in the reporting period and not recognised in net profit or loss\nor other comprehensive income but directly debited or credited to equity:\nCash flow hedges **(85)** 173\nAdjustment on adoption of AASB 9 **7** –\n\nTransaction costs associated with share issuances **–** (20)\n\n**(78)** 153\n\n\n**(b) Deferred tax assets**\n(i) Deferred tax assets\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n\n**2018**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n\n**2017**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\nDeferred tax assets from income tax **1,062** 1,219\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** ANNUAL REPORT 2018 **115**\n\n\n\n(ii) Income tax\n\n\n**Movements**\n\n\n\n**Tax losses**\n\n**and offsets**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Other**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Cash flow**\n\n**hedges**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Provisions**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Finance lease**\n\n\n**liabilities**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Total**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Trade and**\n\n**other payables**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**At 1 January 2017** 973 38 15 20 288 5 1,339\n\nUnder/over provision in prior year (44) 1 – – – – (43)\n(Charged)/credited\n\n–– to profit or loss (73) 49 (1) (4) – (1) (30)\n–– directly to equity (20) – – – (153) 20 (153)\n\n–– tax loss recorded on behalf 1 – – – – – 1\nof Watagan Group\n\n\nAcquisition of subsidiaries 2 89 14 – – – 105\n\n**At 31 December 2017** 839 177 28 16 135 24 1,219\n\n\n**At 1 January 2018** 839 177 28 16 135 24 1,219\n\nUnder/over provision in prior year 41 (25) – – 11 (30) (3)\n(Charged)/credited\n\n–– to profit or loss (321) (23) 6 (3) – 40 (301)\n–– directly to equity – (7) – – 85 – 78\n\n–– tax loss recorded on behalf 66 – – – – – 66\nof Watagan Group\n\nAcquisition of subsidiaries – 7 – – – (4) 3\n\n**At 31 December 2018** 625 129 34 13 231 30 1,062\n\n\nThe Group’s tax consolidated group includes Watagan Mining Company Pty Ltd and its controlled subsidiaries, refer to E2b(i) for further details.\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for the carry forward of unused tax losses and unused tax credits to the extent that it is probable that taxable\nprofits will be available against which the unused tax losses/credits can be utilised.

These capitalised costs are amortised\nover the life of the mine if the roads service the entire mine or\nover the life of the panels accessible from those mains if shorter\nthan the mine life.\n\n\nA regular review is undertaken of each area of interest to\ndetermine the appropriateness of continuing to carry forward\nmine development costs in relation to that area of interest.\nAccumulated costs in relation to an abandoned area are written\noff in full in the period in which the decision to abandon the area\nis made.\n\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** ANNUAL REPORT 2018 **117**\n\n\nOpen cut\nDuring the commercial production stage of open pit operations,\nproduction stripping costs comprise the accumulation of\nexpenses incurred to enable access to the coal seam, and\ninclude direct removal costs (inclusive of an allocation of\noverhead expenditure) and machinery and plant running costs.\n\n\nProduction stripping costs are capitalised as part of an asset, if\nit can be demonstrated that it is probable that future economic\nbenefits will be realised, the costs can be reliably measured and\nthe entity can identify the component of the ore body for which\naccess has been improved. The asset is called a “stripping\nactivity asset” included in mine development.\n\n\nThe stripping activity asset is amortised on a systematic basis,\nover the expected useful life of the identified component of\nthe ore body that becomes more accessible as a result of the\nstripping activity. The units of production method shall be applied.\n\n\nProduction stripping costs that do not satisfy the asset\nrecognition criteria are expensed.\n\n\nDepreciation and amortisation\nThe depreciable amount of all fixed assets, excluding freehold\nland, is depreciated on a straight-line or units of production basis\nover the asset’s useful life to the Group based on life of mine\nplans and Joint Ore Reserves Committee (“JORC”) estimated\nreserves, commencing from the time the asset is held ready for\nuse. Leased assets are depreciated over the asset’s useful life\nor over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term\nif there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain\nownership at the end of the lease term. Leasehold improvements\nare depreciated over the period of the lease or estimated useful\nlife, whichever is the shorter, using the straight-line method.\n\n\nFor some assets, the useful life of the asset is linked to the level\nof production. In such cases, depreciation is charged on a units\nof production basis based on the recoverable reserves or the\nremaining useful hours. Alternatively, the straight-line method\nmay be used where this provides a suitable alternative because\nproduction is not expected to fluctuate significantly from one year\nto another.\n\n\nThe estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation\nmethod are reviewed at the end of each annual reporting\nperiod and any change in estimate is taken into account in the\ndetermination of remaining depreciation charges.\n\n\nThe estimated useful lives are as follows:\n\n\n–– Buildings 10 – 25 years\n\n\n–– Mine development 10 – 40 years\n\n\n–– Plant and equipment 2.5 – 40 years\n\n\n–– Leased plant and equipment 2 – 20 years\n\n\nAn asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its\nrecoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than\nits estimated recoverable amount.\n\n\nAny gain or loss arising on the disposal of an item of property,\nplant and equipment is determined as the difference between\nthe sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is\nrecognised in profit or loss.\n\n\nSee Note C3 for further details on impairment of assets.\n\n\n**118** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** (CONTINUED)\n\n\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018\n\n\n**C – OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES**\n\n\n**C1 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (CONTINUED)**\n\n\n\n**Plant and**\n\n**equipment**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Assets under**\n\n\n**construction**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Freehold land**\n\n**and buildings**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Mine**\n\n**development**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Leased plant**\n**and equipment**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Total**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Year ended 31 December 2017**\n\nOpening net book amount 324 170 381 569 82 1,526\nTransfer to assets under construction (576) 27 308 240 – (1)\n\nAdditions 303 – 21 12 9 345\n\nAcquisition through business combination 33 96 353 844 – 1,326\n\n– – –\nOther disposals (17) (7) (24)\n\n–\nDepreciation (4) (45) (98) (8) (155)\nTransfer to assets classified as held for sale (3) (15) (51) (116) – (185)\nClosing net book amount 81 274 967 1,434 76 2,832\n\n\n**At 31 December 2017**\n\nCost or fair value 81 330 1,310 2,910 105 4,736\n\nAccumulated depreciation – (56) (343) (1,476) (29) (1,904)\n\nNet book amount 81 274 967 1,434 76 2,832\n\n\n**Year ended 31 December 2018**\n\nOpening net book amount 81 274 967 1,434 76 2,832\nTransfer to assets under construction (177) 21 222 (66) – –\n\nOther additions 190 1 10 4 5 210\n\nTransfer from exploration and evaluation – – 10 – – 10\n\nAcquisition through business combinations 8 22 61 136 – 227\n\n– – – –\nOther disposals (9) (9)\n\nDepreciation – (8) (85) (229) (9) (331)\nClosing net book amount 102 310 1,185 1,270 72 2,939\n\n\n**At 31 December 2018**\n\nCost 102 376 1,613 2,975 110 5,176\n\nAccumulated depreciation – (66) (428) (1,705) (38) (2,237)\n\nNet book amount 102 310 1,185 1,270 72 2,939\n\n\nDuring the year ended 31 December 2018 $1 million of depreciation and amortisation was capitalised (2017: $8 million) and no interest was\ncapitalised (2017: $9 million).\n\n\n**(a) Non-current assets pledged as security**\nRefer to Note D2(b) for information on non-current assets pledged as security by the Group.\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** ANNUAL REPORT 2018 **119**\n\n\n**C2 MINING TENEMENTS**\n\n\n**Accounting Policy**\nMining tenements have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Mining\ntenements are amortised from the date when commercial production commences, or the date of acquisition. Amortisation is calculated\nover the life of the mine on a “units of production” method based on the Joint Ore Reserves Committee (“JORC”) estimated reserves.\n\n\nChanges in the annual amortisation rate resulting from changes in the remaining estimated reserves are applied on a prospective basis\nfrom the commencement of the next financial year. Every year the mining tenement’s carrying amount is compared to its recoverable\namount and assessed for impairment, or for possible reversals of prior year impairment.\n\n\nSee Note C3 for further details on the impairment of assets.\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n\n**2018**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n\n**2017**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\nOpening net book amount **4,296** 2,128\n\nAcquisition through business combination **128** 2,456\n\nTransfers from exploration and evaluation **6** 26\n\nImpairment reversal **–** 100\nAmortisation **(188)** (103)\nTransfer to assets classified as held for sale **(24)** (311)\nClosing net book amount **4,218** 4,296\n\n\n**Critical accounting estimates and judgements**\n\nCoal reserves and resources\nThe Group estimates its coal resources and reserves based on information compiled by Competent Persons as defined by the Australasian\nCode for Reporting Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (December 2012), which is prepared by the Joint Ore\nReserves Committee (“JORC”) of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Australian Institute of Geoscientists and Minerals\nCouncil of Australia, known as the JORC 2012 Code, and Australian Securities Exchange (“ASX”) Listing Rules 2012.\n\n\nMineral Resources and Ore Reserves are based on geological information and technical data relating to the size, depth, quality of coal,\nsuitable production techniques and recovery rates. Such an analysis requires complex geological judgements to interpret the data.\nThe estimation of Recoverable Reserves is based on factors such as estimates of foreign exchange rates, coal price, future capital\nrequirements, rehabilitation obligations and production costs, along with geological assumptions and judgements made in estimating\nthe size and quality of the reserves. Management forms a view of forecast sales prices based on long-term forecast coal price data from\nmultiple external sources.\n\n\nThe external sources have determined their benchmark coal price forecasts having regard to the latest International Energy Agency (IEA)\nbase scenario and the Nationally Determined Contributions agreed under the Paris Agreement in 2015. This contemplates the global\nseaborne demand for thermal coal will remain relatively consistent until 2040 whilst the global seaborne demand for metallurgical coal will\nincrease up to 2040.\n\n\nA more rigorous international response to climate change under the Paris Agreement could negatively impact the Recoverable Reserves\nby lowering the forecast sales prices.\n\n\nAdditionally as the economic assumptions used may change and as additional geological information is produced during the operations of\na mine, estimates of reserves may change. The amount of reserves that may actually be mined in the future and the Group’s current reserve\nestimate may vary. Such changes may impact the Group’s reported financial position and results including:\n\n\n–– the carrying value of the exploration and evaluation assets, mine properties, property, plant and equipment and goodwill may be affected\ndue to changes in estimated future cash flows;\n\n–– depreciation and amortisation charges in the statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income may change where such\ncharges are determined using the units of production method, or where the useful life of the related assets change; and\n\n\n–– the carrying value of deferred income tax assets may change due to changes in the judgements regarding the existence of such assets\nand in estimates of the likely recovery of such assets.\n\n\n**120** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** (CONTINUED)\n\n\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018\n\n\n**C – OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES**\n\n\n**C3 IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS**\n\n\n**Accounting policies**\n(i) Long-term assets\nMining tenements and goodwill are tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that\nthey might be impaired.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable\namount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. Mining tenements and other\nnon-financial assets (excluding goodwill) that have previously suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at\nthe end of each reporting period.\n\n\nFor the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped into Cash-Generating Units (“CGUs”), being the lowest levels for which there\nare separately identifiable cash inflows which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. For the\npurposes of goodwill impairment testing, CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment\nis tested reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. The goodwill acquired in a business\ncombination, for the purpose of impairment testing, is allocated to CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.\n\nThe Group assesses impairment by evaluation of conditions and events specific to the Company that may be indicative of\nimpairment triggers.\n\n\n(ii) Other financial assets\nThe Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial\nassets is impaired. A financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective\nevidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a “loss event”) and that\nloss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be\nreliably estimated.\n\nIf there is evidence of impairment for any of the Group’s financial assets carried at amortised cost, the loss is measured as the difference\nbetween the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, excluding future credit losses that have not been\nincurred. The cash flows are discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The loss is recognised in profit or loss.\n\n\n**Critical accounting estimates and judgements**\nThe determination of fair value and value in use requires management to make estimates and assumptions about expected production\nand sales volumes, coal prices (considering current and historical prices, price trends and related factors), foreign exchange rates, coal\nresources and reserves (refer to Note C2), operating costs, closure and rehabilitation costs and future capital expenditure. These estimates\nand assumptions are subject to risk and uncertainty; hence there is a possibility that changes in circumstances will alter these projections,\nwhich may impact the recoverable amount of the assets. In such circumstances, some or all of the carrying amount of the assets may be\nfurther impaired or the impairment charge reduced with the impact recorded in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n\n**(a) CGU assessment**\nThe Group operates on a regional basis within NSW and as such the NSW mines are considered to be one CGU. From 2017, Hunter Valley\nOperations and Mount Thorley Warkworth have been included in the NSW regional CGU alongside Moolarben and Stratford/Duralie. Yarrabee\nand Middlemount are considered separate CGUs due to location and ownership structure.\n\n\n**(b) Assessment of fair value**\nEach CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal has been determined using a discounted cash flow model over the expected life of mine\n(18 – 42 years). The fair value model adopted has been categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** ANNUAL REPORT 2018 **121**\n\n\nThe key assumptions in the model include:\n\n\n**Key assumptions** **Description**\n\n\nCoal prices The Group’s cash flow forecasts are based on estimates of future coal prices, which assume benchmark\nprices will revert to the Group’s assessment of the long-term real coal prices of US$67 – US$104 per tonne\n(2017: US$65 – US$101 per tonne) for thermal and US$112 – US$217 per tonne (2017: US$110 – US$190\nper tonne) for metallurgical coal.\n\n\nThe Group receives long-term forecast coal price data from multiple external sources when determining its\nbenchmark coal price forecasts and then makes adjustments for specific coal qualities.\n\n\nThe external sources have determined their benchmark coal price forecasts having regard to the latest\nInternational Energy Agency (IEA) New Policy Scenario, the Nationally Determined Contributions submitted\nin the lead-up to the Paris Agreement in 2015 and National Energy Policies. This contemplates the global\nseaborne demand for thermal coal will remain relatively consistent until 2040 whilst the global seaborne demand\nfor metallurgical coal will increase up to 2040. Key risks to the outlooks are increasing decarbonisation trends,\ntrade disputes, protectionism, import control policies in China and investor behaviour to coal project financing.\n\n\nThe Group has considered the impacts of a more rigorous international response to climate change under the\nParis Agreement and notes that the average mine life required for the recoverable amount to continue to exceed\nthe book value, holding all inputs constant, including coal prices, is seven, seven and three years for the NSW,\nYarrabee and Middlemount CGUs, respectively. The NSW CGU has an 80% exposure to thermal coal and 20%\nexposure to metallurgical coal whilst Yarrabee and Middlemount are both metallurgical coal mines.\n\n\nThe Group concludes that whilst a more rigorous international response to climate change could reduce the\nfuture demand for coal the likely impacts of any such actions are not expected to materially impact during the\ntime periods noted above and hence would not result in the recoverable amount falling below book value.\n\n\nFor both thermal and metallurgical coal the Group’s forecast coal price is within the range of external\nprice forecasts.\nForeign exchange rates The long-term AUD/USD forecast exchange rate of $0.75 (2017: $0.75) is based on external sources.\nThe year end AUD/USD exchange rate was $0.71 per the Reserve Bank of Australia.\nProduction and capital costs Production and capital costs are based on the Group’s estimate of forecast geological conditions, stage\nof existing plant and equipment and future production levels.\n\nThis information is obtained from internally maintained budgets, the five-year business plan, life of mine models,\nlife of mine plans, JORC reports, and project evaluations performed by the Group in its ordinary course\nof business.\n\nCoal reserves and resources See discussion at Note C2 Mining tenements for how the coal reserves and resources are determined.\nDiscount rate The Group has applied a post-tax discount rate of 10.5% (2017: 10.5%) to discount the forecast future\nattributable post-tax cash flows.\n\nThe post-tax discount rate applied to the future cash flow forecasts represents an estimate of the rate the\nmarket would apply having regard to the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the\nfuture cash flow estimates have not been adjusted.\n\nThis rate is also consistent with the Group’s five-year business plan, life of mine models and project evaluations\nperformed in the ordinary course of business.\n\n\nBased on the above assumptions at 31 December 2018 the recoverable amount is determined to be above book value for all CGUs resulting\nin no further impairment.\n\n\nAt 31 December 2017, the remaining impairment provision at Moolarben of $100 million was reversed. Management assessed the following\nas being reasons for the reversal:\n\n\n–– both the NSW CGU and Moolarben standalone recoverable amounts are above book value;\n\n–– completion of open cut expansions and commencement of underground mining operations during 2017 have derisked future cash flows\nand increased production from 8Mt in 2014 to approximately 17Mt of ROM coal; and\n\n\n–– current and life of mine operating costs and capital expenditure have decreased.\n\n\nThe impairment reversal was recognised through the profit and loss.\n\nImpairment provisions recorded as at 31 December 2018 is $72 million for Stratford and Duralie. Stratford and Duralie is included in the NSW\nregion CGU. Management may consider reversals of the impairment provision previously recognised if there is either an increase in the average\nlong-term real revenue over the life of the mine due to either an increase in USD coal prices, or a weakening of the AUD/USD foreign exchange\nrate or a combination of both, or reductions in the current and life of mine operating costs, capital expenditure requirements, or an increase in\nthe reserves.\n\n\nIn determining the value assigned to each key assumption, management has used external sources of information; the expertise of external\nconsultants; as well as the experience of experts within the Group to validate entity-specific assumptions such as coal reserves and resources.\nAdditionally various sensitivities have been determined and considered with respect to each of the key assumptions, further supporting the\nabove fair value conclusions.\n\n\n**122** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** (CONTINUED)\n\n\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018\n\n\n**C – OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES**\n\n\n**C3 IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS (CONTINUED)**\n\n\n**Key sensitivity**\nThe most sensitive input in the fair value model is forecast revenue, which is primarily dependent on estimated future coal prices and the\nAUD/USD forecast exchange rate.\n\n\n\n**Yarrabee**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Middlemount**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**2018**\n\n\n\n**NSW**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\nBook Value 5,590 396 324\n\nRecoverable Amount 12,668 605 629\n\nHead Room 7,078 209 305\n\n\nUS$ Coal Price [(i)]\n\n\n+10% 2,361 289 146\n\n–10% (2,347) (299) (163)\n\n\nExchange Rate [(ii)]\n\n+5 cents (1,526) (176) (96)\n\n–5 cents 1,879 215 110\n\n\nDiscount Rate [(iii)]\n\n\n+50 bps (512) (20) (11)\n\n–50 bps 568 17 9\n\n\n(i) This represents the change in recoverable amount due to a +/– 10% change to our coal price assumption.\n\n\n(ii) This represents the change in recoverable amount due to a +/– 5 cents change to the long-term US$:A$ foreign exchange rate adopted.\n\n\n(iii) This represents the change in recoverable amount due to a +/– 50bps change in discount rate adopted.\n\n\nIf coal prices were –10% LOM the recoverable amount would exceed book value for all CGUs with the exception of Yarrabee which exceeded\nthe recoverable amount by $90 million.

These costs are only carried forward where the right of tenure for the area of interest is current\nand to the extent that they are expected to be recouped through successful development and commercial exploitation, or alternatively,\nsale of the area, or where activities in the area have not yet reached a stage which permits reasonable assessment of the existence of\neconomically recoverable reserves and active and significant operations in, or in relation to, the area of interest are continuing.\n\n\nExploration and evaluation assets acquired in a business combination are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date. The carrying\namount of exploration and evaluation assets is assessed for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest the carrying amount of the\nassets may exceed their recoverable amount. A regular review is undertaken for each area of interest to determine the appropriateness of\ncontinuing to carry forward costs in relation to each area of interest. Accumulated costs in relation to an abandoned area are written off in\nfull in the period in which the decision to abandon the area is made.\n\n\nOnce the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the extraction of mineral resources in an area of interest are demonstrable,\nthe exploration and evaluation assets attributable to that area of interest are first tested for impairment and then reclassified to\nmining tenements.\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** ANNUAL REPORT 2018 **123**\n\n\n**Critical accounting estimates and judgements**\nThe application of the Group’s accounting policy for exploration and evaluation expenditure requires judgement in determining whether it\nis likely that future economic benefits are likely, which may be based on assumptions about future events or circumstances.

Timing is dependent upon when the mines cease to produce\nat economically viable rates, which in turn will depend upon future coal prices, which are inherently uncertain.\n\nTake or pay In acquiring part of a business or operation, an assessment is made on the fair value of the assets and liabilities under\nAASB 3 _Business Combinations_ . Take or pay is the assessment of forecast excess capacity for port and rail contracts.\nA provision was recognised for the discounted estimated excess capacity. The provision has a finite life and will be\nreleased to profit or loss over the period in which excess capacity is realised.\n\n\n**Key estimate and judgement:**\nThe provision is recognised and estimated based on management’s assessment of contracted port capacity versus\nforecast usage. This involves making assumptions about the probability, amount and timing of an outflow of resources\nembodying economic benefits.\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** ANNUAL REPORT 2018 **129**\n\n\n**Provision** **Description**\n\nSales contract In acquiring part of a business or operation, an assessment is made of the fair value of the assets and liabilities under\nAASB 3 _Business Combinations_ . The sales contract provision is the assessment of a coal supply and transportation\nagreement to supply coal to BLCP Power Limited in Thailand at below market prices. A provision was recognised for the\ndiscounted estimated variance between contract and market prices. The provision has a finite life and will be released to\nprofit or loss over the contract term.\n\n\n**Key estimate and judgement:**\nThe provision is recognised and estimated based on management’s assessment of future market prices.\nOther provisions The provision includes marketing services fee payable to Noble Group Limited deemed above market norms, contingent\nroyalties payable to Rio Tinto Plc assessed as part of the Coal & Allied Industries Ltd (“Coal & Allied”) acquisition in 2017\nwhich will be amortised over the contract term, and make good provisions to cover the cost to “make good” any hired\nequipment, in case any major overhaul costs are incurred at the end of the lease period.\n\n\n**Key estimate and judgement:**\nThe provision is recognised and estimated based on management’s assessment of future market prices of coal.\n\n\n**C12 ASSETS CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE**\n\n\n**Accounting Policies**\nNon-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale\nor loss of control transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the asset (or disposal group)\nis available for immediate sale or disposal in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales or disposals\nof such assets (or disposal groups) and the transaction is highly probable. Management must be committed to the transaction, which\nshould be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed transaction within one year from the date of classification.\n\n\nWhen the Group is committed to a sale plan or other transaction involving loss of control of a subsidiary, all of the assets and liabilities\nof that subsidiary are classified as held for sale when the criteria described above are met, regardless of whether the Group will retain a\nnon‑controlling interest in its former subsidiary after the sale.\n\nNon-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their previous carrying amount and fair\nvalue less costs to sell.\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n\n**2018**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n\n**2017**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Current assets**\n\nInvestment in associate (i) **–** 25\n\nInterest in joint ventures (ii) **–** 531\n\nLand held for sale (iii) **57** 57\n\n**Total current assets** **57** 613\n\n\n**Current liabilities**\n\nInterest in joint ventures (ii) **–** 67\n\n**Total current liabilities** **–** 67\n\n\n**(i) Investment in associate**\nThe investment in associate was included in the asset sale agreement with Glencore as disclosed further in Note E1. An indirect interest in Port\nWaratah Coal Services Pty Ltd of 6.5%, held via shares in Newcastle Coal Shippers Pty Ltd, was sold for US$20 million and completed in 2018.\n\n\n**(ii) Interest in joint ventures**\nOn 27 July 2017 the Company announced that it had entered into a binding agreement to establish a 51:49 unincorporated joint venture with\nGlencore in relation to HVO, following completion of the Group’s acquisition of Coal & Allied from Rio Tinto. Glencore paid cash consideration\nof US$429 million to the Group for a 16.6% interest in HVO, and this amount was reduced by the net cash flows generated by the 16.6% HVO\ninterest from 1 September 2017 to the date of completion. The consideration also include a 27.9% share of US$240 million of non-contingent\nroyalties and 49% of HVO contingent royalties payable by the Group and a net debt and working capital adjustment in respect of the Coal &\nAllied acquisition. The US$429 million includes US$20 million associated with the sale of shares in Newcastle Coal Shippers Pty Ltd held by\nCoal & Allied to Glencore noted above. The sale was completed on 4 May 2018.\n\n\n**(iii) Land held for sale**\nThe land held for sale refers to parcels of non-mining land located in the Lower Hunter Valley that are held for future sale. These were acquired\nas part of the acquisition of Coal & Allied at fair value.\n\n\n**130** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** (CONTINUED)\n\n\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018\n\n\n**D – CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING**\n\n\nThe ability of the Group to fund the investment in its ongoing activities, invest in new opportunities and meet current commitments is dependent\non available cash and access to third party capital. This section contains disclosure on interest-bearing liabilities, contingencies, financial risk\nmanagement, reserves and contributed equity that are required to finance the Group’s activities.\n\n\n**D1 INTEREST-BEARING LOAN TO ASSOCIATE**\n\n\n**Accounting Policy**\nFinancial assets classified as loans are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active\nmarket. They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the reporting period which\nare classified as non-current assets.

The purchase price was\nfunded by way of a $1,363 million loan from Yancoal Australia Ltd to Watagan bearing interest of BBSY plus 7.06% with a maturity date of\n1 April 2025. The outstanding interest and principal of this loan is guaranteed by Yankuang Group Co. Ltd, the Group’s ultimate parent entity.\nWatagan can make prepayments of the outstanding loan balance with any such prepayment capable of redraw in the future.\n\n\n**D2 INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES**\n\n\n**Accounting Policies**\n(i) Interest-bearing liabilities\nInterest-bearing liabilities (excluding financial guarantees) are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs. They are subsequently\nmeasured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. US dollar interest-bearing loans are designated as a hedge instrument\nin a cash flow hedge (refer to note D7). Refer to Note F6(b) for detailed policies in relation to recognition, classification, measurement and\nderecognition of interest-bearing liabilities.\n\n\n(ii) Leases\nProperty, plant and equipment held by the Group under leases that transfer to the Group substantially all of the risks and rewards of\nownership are classified as finance leases.\n\n\nThe leased property, plant and equipment are initially measured at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present\nvalue of the minimum lease payments. Subsequently they are accounted for in accordance with the property, plant and equipment\naccounting policy.\n\n\nThe corresponding minimum lease payments are included in lease liabilities within interest-bearing liabilities. Each lease payment is allocated\nbetween finance cost and a reduction in the outstanding lease liability. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so\nas to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.\n\nThe net gains arising on the sale of an asset and the leasing back of the same asset using a finance lease are included as deferred income\nin the balance sheet and are released to the profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n\n\n(iii) Borrowing costs\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of assets, that necessarily take a substantial period of\ntime to prepare for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for\ntheir intended use or sale.\n\n\nAll other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** ANNUAL REPORT 2018 **131**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n\n**2018**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n\n**2017**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Current**\n\nSecured lease liabilities (refer to Note F1(b)) **13** 17\n\n**13** 17\n\n\n**Non-current**\n\nSecured bank loans **2,572** 3,141\n\nSecured lease liabilities (refer to Note F1(b)) **29** 38\n\nUnsecured loans from related parties **1,510** 1,527\n\n**4,111** 4,706\n\n**Total interest-bearing liabilities** **4,124** 4,723\n\n\n\n**AU $M**\n\n**Facilities**\n\n\n\n**Balance**\n\n**31 Dec 2017**\n\n\n\n**Debt**\n\n**drawdown**\n\n\n\n**Debt**\n\n**repayment**\n\n\n\n**Lease**\n\n**repayment**\n\n\n\n**New**\n\n**Leases**\n\n\n\n**Non-Substantial**\n\n**Modification**\n\n\n\n**Foreign exchange**\n\n**movements**\n\n\n\n**Balance**\n\n**31 Dec 2018**\n\n\n\nSecured bank loan 3,141 411 (1,250) – – (13) 283 **2,572**\n\nLoans from related parties 1,527 – (175) – – – 158 **1,510**\n\nFinance leases 55 – – (20) 7 – – **42**\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities **4,723** **411** **(1,425)** **(20)** **7** **(13)** **441** **4,124**\n\n\nInterest costs incurred on finance leases amounted to $3 million to 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: $3 million).\n\nOn the adoption of AASB 9 _Financial Instruments_ the secured bank loans were adjusted as a result of a refinancing during 2017.

The Group’s overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise\npotential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group. The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange\ncontracts to hedge certain risk exposures. Derivatives are exclusively used for hedging purposes and not as speculative instruments. The Group\nuses different methods to measure different types of risk to which it is exposed. These methods include sensitivity analysis in the case of foreign\nexchange, interest rate risk and other price risks, and ageing analysis for credit risk.\n\nThe Group holds the following financial instruments:\n\n\n(i) Cash and cash equivalents;\n\n\n(ii) Trade and other receivables (including WIPS);\n\n\n(iii) Trade and other payables;\n\n(iv) Interest-bearing liabilities, including bank loans and finance leases;\n\n\n(v) Available for sale investments;\n\n\n(vi) Royalty receivable;\n\n\n(vii) Non-contingent royalty receivable;\n\n\n(viii) Non-contingent royalty payable;\n\n(ix) Derivative financial instruments; and\n\n\n(x) Interest-bearing loan from associate.\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n\n**2018**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n\n**2017**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Financial assets**\n\nCash and cash equivalents **1,031** 207\n\n_Loans and receivables – amortised cost_\n\nTrade and other receivables **844** 1,131\n\nNon-contingent royalty receivable **15** –\n\nInterest-bearing loan to associates **835** 712\n_Assets at fair value through profit and loss_\n\nRoyalty receivable **193** 199\n\nWIPS **–** 29\n\n**2,918** 2,278\n\n\n**Financial liabilities**\n\n_Amortised cost_\n\nTrade and other payables **840** 758\n\nInterest-bearing liabilities **4,124** 4,723\n\nNon-contingent royalty payable **52** 160\n\n**5,016** 5,641\n\n\nThe Board of Directors has overall responsibility for determining risk management objectives and policies and risk management is carried\nout by the Group Audit and Risk Management department along with the Group Treasury department. The Board provides written principles\nfor overall risk management, as well as policies covering specific areas such as the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate foreign\nexchange risk. These derivative instruments create an obligation or right that effectively transfers one or more of the risks associated with an\nunderlying financial instrument, asset or obligation.\n\nThe overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk and volatility in financial performance without unduly affecting\ncompetitiveness and flexibility. Further details regarding these policies are set out below.\n\n\n**(a) Market risk**\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, securities prices, and coal prices, will affect\nthe Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.\n\n\n(i) Foreign exchange risk\nThe Group operates entirely in Australia and its costs are primarily denominated in its functional currency, the Australian dollar. Export coal sales\nare denominated in US dollars and a strengthening of the Australian dollar against the US dollar has an adverse impact on earnings and cash\nflow settlement. Liabilities for some plant and equipment purchases and loans are denominated in currencies other than the Australian dollar\nand a weakening of the Australian dollar against other currencies has an adverse impact on earnings and cash flow settlement.\n\n\nThe hedging policy of the Group aims to protect against the volatility of cash expenditures or reduced collection in the abovementioned\ntransactions as well as to reduce the volatility of profit or loss for retranslation of US dollar denominated loans at each period end.\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** ANNUAL REPORT 2018 **141**\n\n\n_Hedging through bank issued instruments_\nOperating foreign exchange risk that arises from firm commitments or highly probable transactions is managed through the use of bank issued\nforward foreign currency contracts. The Group hedges a portion of contracted US dollar sales receivables and asset purchases settled in\nforeign currencies in each currency to mitigate the adverse impact on cash flow due to the future rise or fall in Australian dollars against the\nrelevant currencies.\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in Other\nComprehensive Income in the hedging reserve until the anticipated underlying transaction occurs. Once the anticipated underlying transaction\noccurs, amounts accumulated in equity are recycled through the profit or loss or recognised as part of the cost of the asset to which it relates.\nThe ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised immediately\nin the profit or loss. In the current period, the loss relating to the ineffective portion was $nil (2017: $nil).\n\n\n_Natural cash flow hedge_\nThe Group currently does not use bank issued instruments to hedge foreign exchange risks in respect of US dollar denominated loans; however,\nthe scheduled repayment of the principal on US dollar loans is designated to hedge the cash flow risks on the portion of forecast US dollar\nsales that are not hedged through bank issued instruments (“natural cash flow hedge”). US dollar loan repayments up to a six-month period are\ndesignated to hedge the forecast US dollar sales during the same period after the designation of the hedge relationship based on a dollar for\ndollar basis until the hedge ratio reaches one.\n\n\nHedging effectiveness is determined by comparing the changes in the hedging instruments and hedged sales. Hedge ineffectiveness will occur\nwhen cash flows generated by sales transactions are lower than the forecast sales transaction. In cases of hedge ineffectiveness, gains or\nlosses in relation to the excess portion in the foreign exchange movement of the designated US dollar loan repayment will be recycled to profit\nor loss. The effective portion of changes in the hedging instruments will be recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve in Other Comprehensive\nIncome. When the sales transactions occur, amounts accumulated in equity are recycled through the profit or loss as an increase or decrease to\nsales revenue.\n\n\n_Royalty receivable_\nThe royalty receivable from the Middlemount Joint Venture is estimated based on expected future cash flows that are dependent on sales\nvolumes, US dollar denominated coal prices and the US dollar foreign exchange rate (refer to Note C9).\n\n\n_Other assets_\n\nOther assets include the US$10 million associated with the Warkworth Call Option which was completed in March 2018, and the promissory\nnote receivable as discussed in Note C7(i). These balances are predominantly held in US dollars and expected to settle within 12 months.\n\n\n_Non-contingent royalty payable and receivable_\nAs part of the acquisition of Coal & Allied in 2017 the Company has agreed to make deferred non-contingent royalty payments to Rio Tinto Plc\n(“Rio Tinto”) in US dollars. As described in Note E1 27.9% of non-contingent royalty payable is received from Glencore.\n\n\nThe Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk at the end of the reporting period, expressed in Australian dollars, was as follows:\n\n\n**31 December 2018** **31 December 2017**\n\n**USD $M** **HKD $M** **USD $M** **HKD $M**\n\n\nCash and cash equivalents **560** **189** 139 –\n\nTrade and other receivables **375** **–** 432 –\n\nOther assets **48** **–** 49 –\n\nNon-contingent royalty receivable **193** **–** 199 –\n\n**–** –\nTrade and other payables **(295)** (249)\n\n**–** –\nInterest bearing liabilities **(4,096)** (4,668)\nNon-contingent royalty payable **(52)** **–** (167) –\nNet exposure **(3,267)** **189** (4,265) –\n\n\n_Sensitivity_\nThe following table summarises the sensitivity of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities to a reasonable possible change in the US dollar\nexchange rate. The Group’s exposure to other foreign exchange movements is not material. The Group has used the observed range of actual\nhistorical rates for the preceding five-year period, with a heavier weighting placed on recently observed market data, in determining reasonably\npossible exchange movements to be used for the current year’s sensitivity analysis. Past movements are not necessarily indicative of future\nmovements. A 10% depreciation/appreciation of the Australian dollar against the US dollar would have (decreased)/increased equity and profit\nor loss after tax by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.\n\n\n**142** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** (CONTINUED)\n\n\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018\n\n\n**D – CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING**\n\n\n**D9 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)**\n\n\n**(a) Market risk (continued)**\n(i) Foreign exchange risk (continued)\n\n\n**10% depreciation of AUD/USD** **10% appreciation of AUD/USD**\n**Profit before** **Profit before**\n\n\n\n**income tax**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Equity**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**income tax**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Equity**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**2018**\n\nCash and cash equivalents **58** **–** **(48)** **–**\n\nTrade and other receivables **29** **–** **(24)** **–**\nNon-contingent royalty receivable **19** **–** **(16)** **–**\nOther assets **4** **–** **(3)** **–**\nTotal increase/(decrease) in financial assets **110** **–** **(91)** **–**\nTrade and other payables **(23)** **–** **19** **–**\nInterest-bearing liabilities **–** **(319)** **–** **261**\nNon-contingent royalty payable **(4)** **–** **4** **–**\nTotal (increase)/decrease in financial liabilities **(27)** **(319)** **23** **261**\nTotal increase/(decrease) in profit before tax and equity **83** **(319)** **(68)** **261**\n\n\n**2017**\n\nCash and cash equivalents 11 – (9) –\n\nTrade and other receivables 34 – (28) –\nNon-contingent royalty receivable 17 – (19) –\nOther assets 4 – (38) –\nTotal increase/(decrease) in financial assets 66 – (94) –\nTrade and other payables (19) – 26 –\nInterest-bearing liabilities – (363) – 297\nNon-contingent royalty payable (13) – 11 –\nTotal (increase)/decrease in financial liabilities (32) (363) 37 297\nTotal increase/(decrease) in profit before tax and equity 34 (363) (57) 297\n\n\nEquity movements above reflect movements in the hedge reserve due to foreign exchange movements on USD interest-bearing loans.\n\n\n(ii) Price risk\nThe price risk of the Group includes coal price risk.\n\n\nThe Group does not enter into commodity contracts other than to meet the Group’s expected usage and sales requirements; such contracts are\nnot settled net. The royalty receivables from Middlemount are exposed to fluctuations in coal price. The Group currently does not have any derivative\nhedges in place against the movement in the spot coal price. Refer to Note D9(d)(iii) for the royalty receivable coal price sensitivity analysis.\n\nCoal sales are predominately provisionally priced initially. Provisionally priced sales are those for which price finalisation, referenced to the relevant\nindex, is outstanding at the reporting date. Provisional pricing mechanisms embedded within these sales arrangements have the character of a\ncommodity derivative and are carried at fair value through profit and loss as part of trade receivables. The final sales price is determined normally\nseven to 90 days after delivery to the customer. At 31 December 2018 there were $234 million of provisionally priced sales. If prices were to\nincrease by 10% provisionally priced sales would increase by $23 million.\n\n\n(iii) Interest rate risk\nThe Group is subject to interest rate risk that arises from borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash. Generally, no variable\ninterest is receivable or payable on the Group’s trade and other receivables or payables where applicable as they are fixed in nature and therefore\nthey are not exposed to the interest rate risk.\n\nThe Group’s cash flow interest rate risk for assets primarily arises from cash at bank and deposits subject to market bank rates. Floating rate\nborrowings bearing LIBOR rates are re-set on a quarterly basis.\n\n\nThe Group’s exposure to interest rate risk and the weighted average interest rate is set out as below:\n\n\n**31 December 2018** **31 December 2017**\n\n**Weighted average** **Weighted average**\n\n\n\n**interest rate**\n\n\n**%**\n\n\n\n**Balance**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Balance**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**interest rate**\n\n\n**%**\n\n\n\nCash and cash equivalents **1.4%** **1,030** 1.3% 207\n\nRestricted cash **–** **–** 3.0% 1\n\nBank loans and other borrowings **5.9%** **2,572** 5.0% 3,141\nInterest-bearing loan to associate **9.1%** **835** 8.9% 712\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** ANNUAL REPORT 2018 **143**\n\n\n_Sensitivity_\nThe following table summarises the sensitivity of the Group’s significant financial assets and liabilities to changes in variable interest rates.\nThis sensitivity is based on reasonably possible changes, determined using observed historical interest rate movements for the preceding fiveyear period, with a heavier weighting given to more recent market data. Past movements are not necessarily indicative of future movements.\nFor financial assets, a 25 basis point (decrease)/increase in interest rates would have (decreased)/increased equity and profit or loss after tax by\nthe amounts shown below. For financial liabilities, a 25 basis point (decrease)/increase in interest rates would have increased/(decreased) equity\nand profit or loss after tax by the amounts shown below.

As at\n31 December 2018 the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk which will cause a financial loss to the Group due to failure to discharge\nan obligation by the counterparties and financial guarantees provided by the Group is arising from the carrying amount of the respective\nrecognised financial assets as stated in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the amount of contingent liabilities in relation to financial\nguarantees issued by the Group as disclosed in Note D8.\n\n\nIn order to minimise credit risk, the management of the Group has delegated a team responsible for determination of credit limits, credit\napprovals and other monitoring procedures to ensure that follow-up action is taken to recover overdue debts. In addition, the Group reviews\nthe recoverable amount of each individual trade debt at the end of the reporting period to ensure that adequate impairment losses are made\nfor irrecoverable amounts. In this regard, the Directors consider that the Group’s credit risk is significantly reduced. The Group maintains its\ncash and cash equivalents with reputable banks. Therefore, the Directors consider that the credit risk for such amounts is minimal.\n\n\nIn assessing the Expected Credit Losses (“ECL”) of trade receivables management assesses historical write-offs of trade receivables, ageing\nof debtors and whether sufficient credit enhancement is provided by customers (letters of credit and bank guarantees). If the ageing of trade\nreceivables significantly increased then the recognition of ECL would need to be reassessed.\n\n\nReceivables will only be written off if there is demonstrable evidence that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.\n\n\nThere was no provision for lifetime or 12-month ECL recognised for trade receivables as at 31 December 2018 as there are minimal aged debts.\n\n\nThe credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited as the counterparties are banks with credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating\nagencies that are at least investment grade.\n\n\nCredit risk in trade receivables is managed in the following ways:\n\n\n(i) payment terms and credit limits are set for individual customers;\n\n\n(ii) a risk assessment process is used for all customers; and\n\n\n(iii) letters of credit are required for those customers assessed as posing a higher risk.\n\nAs disclosed in Note D2(a)(i) the minimum average balance of AU$25 million per day and at month end AU$50 million is required to be held\nin the Lender Accounts of the Syndicated Facility which is not available for use on those days.\n\nThe maximum exposure to credit risk on financial assets which have been recognised in the balance sheet is their carrying amount less\nimpairment provision, if any, as set out below.\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n\n**2018**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n\n**2017**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\nCash and cash equivalents **1,031** 207\n\nTrade and other receivables **844** 1,131\n\n**1,875** 1,338\n\n\nIncluded in trade and other receivables are significant customers located in Singapore, Australia, Japan and Taiwan that account for 18%, 17%,\n16% and 14% of trade receivables respectively (2017: Singapore 30%, Japan 23%, Australia 14% and Hong Kong 8%).\n\nThe top five customers included in trade receivables with the largest gross receivable balance as at 31 December 2018 account for 33% of\ntrade receivables (2017: 27%).\n\n\n**144** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** (CONTINUED)\n\n\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018\n\n\n**D – CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING**\n\n\n**D9 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)**\n\n\n**(c) Liquidity risk**\nLiquidity risk includes the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group will be impacted in the\nfollowing ways:\n\n(i) will not have sufficient funds to settle transactions on the due date;\n\n(ii) will be forced to sell financial assets at a value which is less than what they are worth; or\n\n(iii) may be unable to settle or recover a financial asset at all.\n\nLiquidity risk is managed by maintaining sufficient cash and liquid deposit balances and having readily accessible standby facilities in place\nin accordance with the Board’s risk management policy. Details regarding finance facilities are set out in Note D2.\n\nMaturities of financial liabilities\nThe tables below analyse the Group’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on their contractual maturities and interest\npayments for all liabilities.\n\nThe amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows including interest payments.

AASB 13 _Fair Value Measurement_ requires disclosure\nof fair value measurements by level in accordance with the following fair value measurement hierarchy:\n\n\n(a) quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1);\n\n\n(b) \u0007inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly\n\n(derived from prices) (Level 2); and\n\n\n(c) \u0007inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) (Level 3).\n\n\nThe following table presents the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities measured and recognised at fair value at 31 December 2018\nand 31 December 2017:\n\n\n\n**Level 1**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Level 2**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Level 3**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Total**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**31 December 2018**\n\n**Assets**\n\nRoyalty receivable **–** **–** **193** **193**\n\nWIPS **–** **–** **–** **–**\n\n**Total assets** **–** **–** **193** **193**\n\n\n**Liabilities**\n\nOther derivatives **–** **–** **–** **–**\n\n**Total liabilities** **–** **–** **–** **–**\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** ANNUAL REPORT 2018 **145**\n\n\n\n**Level 1**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Level 2**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Level 3**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Total**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**31 December 2017**\n\n**Assets**\n\nRoyalty receivable – – 199 199\n\nWIPS – – 29 29\n\n**Total assets** – – 228 228\n\n\n**Liabilities**\n\nOther derivatives – – – –\n\n**Total liabilities** – – – –\n\n\n(ii) Valuation techniques\nThe fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation techniques. These valuation\ntechniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are\nobservable, the instrument is included in Level 2.\n\nIf one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3. This is the case for the\nroyalty receivable and WIPS.\n\n\n(iii) Fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3)\nThe following table presents the changes in Level 3 instruments for the year ended 31 December 2018:\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n\n**2018**\n\n**Royalty**\n**Receivable**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**31 December**\n\n\n**2017**\n\n**Royalty**\n**Receivable**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\nOpening balance **199** 199\nCash received/receivable **(31)** (29)\n\nUnwinding of the discount **21** 21\nRemeasurement of the royalty receivable recognised in profit and loss **4** 8\nClosing balance **193** 199\n\n\n_Royalty receivable_\nThe fair value of the royalty receivable is the fair value of the right to receive a royalty of 4% of Free on Board Trimmed Sales from the\nMiddlemount mine. The financial asset has a finite life being the life of the Middlemount mine and will be measured on a fair value basis.\n\nThe fair value is determined using the discounted future cash flows that are dependent on the following unobservable inputs: forecast sales\nvolumes, coal prices and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The forecast sales volumes are based on the internally maintained budgets,\nfive‑year business plan and life of mine models. The forecast coal prices and long-term exchange rates are based on external data consistent\nwith the data used for impairment assessments (refer to Note C3). The risk-adjusted post-tax discount rate used to determine the future cash\nflows is 10.0%.\n\nThe estimated fair value could increase significantly if the following unobservable inputs of sales volumes and coal prices were higher and if the\nAustralian dollar weakens against the US dollar. The estimated fair value would also increase if the risk-adjusted discount rate was lower.\n\n\n_Sensitivity_\nThe following tables summarise the sensitivity analysis of royalty receivable.

The consideration transferred\nfor the acquisition of a subsidiary comprises the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued\nby the Group. The consideration transferred also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration arrangement and the fair value of\nany pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred including stamp duty. Identifiable assets\nacquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at their\nfair values at the acquisition date.\n\n\nThe excess of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition date fair value\nof any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets acquired is recorded as\ngoodwill. If those amounts are less than the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the subsidiary acquired and the measurement of all\namounts has been reviewed, the difference is recognised directly in profit or loss as a gain on acquisition of subsidiaries.\n\n\n**Critical accounting estimates and judgements**\nAcquisition accounting\nAccounting for acquisition of businesses requires judgement and estimates in determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities.\nTechniques used to determine the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities include an income and cost approach for mining tenements\nand depreciated replacement cost for the valuation of property, plant and equipment.\n\nThe relevant accounting standard allows the fair value of assets acquired to be refined for a window of one year after the acquisition date,\nand judgement is required to ensure the adjustments made reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed\nas of the acquisition date. The adjustments made on fair value of assets are retrospective in nature and have an impact on goodwill or gain\nrecognised on acquisition.\n\n\n**(a) Acquisition of 4% of Moolarben**\n(i) Summary of acquisition\nOn 30 November 2018, Moolarben Coal Mine Pty Ltd, a 100% owned subsidiary of Yancoal Australia Ltd, acquired a 4% interest in Moolarben\nCoal Joint Venture (“Moolarben JV”) from Kores Australia Moolarben Coal Pty Ltd (“Kores”). The Moolarben JV is accounted for as a joint\noperation. With the 4% acquisition the Group now holds an 85% interest in the Moolarben JV. The cash consideration paid and payable\nwas $84 million, split over four instalments of $21 million each, and reduced by a $21 million effective date adjustment whereby the cash\nconsideration was reduced by 4% of the Moolarben JV’s net cash inflow from the date of the sales agreement (15 April 2018) to completion.\n\n\n(ii) Assets and liabilities acquired\nDetails of the purchase consideration and the net assets and liabilities acquired of the additional interest in the Moolarben JV are as follows:\n\n\n**$M**\n\n\nPurchase consideration:\n\nPurchase price **84**\nEffective date adjustment **(21)**\n\nTotal consideration **63**\n\n\nGain on acquisition of interest in joint operation **–**\n\nFair value of net identifiable assets acquired **63**\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** ANNUAL REPORT 2018 **147**\n\n\nThe assets and liabilities recognised as a result of the acquisition are as follows:\n\n\n**Fair value $M**\n\n\nCash **2**\n\nTrade and other receivables **2**\n\nInventories **3**\n\nOther current assets **1**\n\nProperty, plant and equipment **52**\n\nMining tenements **1**\nTrade and other payables **(5)**\n\nProvisions **(2)**\n\nDeferred tax assets **9**\nFair value of net identifiable assets acquired **63**\n\n\nNet assets acquired **63**\n\n\nThe accounting for the acquisition has been determined on a provisional basis at 31 December 2018.

If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2018, consolidated revenue and net profit before tax for the period ended\n31 December 2018 would have been $78 million and $40 million respectively. These amounts have been calculated using the Group’s\naccounting policies.\n\n\n**(b) Disposal of 16.6% interest in Hunter Valley Operation to Glencore**\n(i) Summary of disposal\nOn 4 May 2018, the Company announced that it had completed the establishment of a 51%:49% unincorporated joint venture with Glencore\nCoal Pty Ltd (“Glencore”) in relation to Hunter Valley Operations (“HVO JV”) as was previously announced on 27 July 2017 and held a 51%:49%\nshareholding in HVO Services Pty Ltd, HV Operations Pty Ltd and HVO Coal Sales Pty Ltd (together the “HVO entities”).\n\nGlencore paid cash consideration of US$1,139 million for 49% of HVO JV and the HVO entities, of which US$710 million was paid to Mitsubishi\nDevelopment Pty Ltd (“MDP”) for its 32.4% interest and US$429 million was paid to a wholly owned subsidiary of Yancoal, Coal & Allied\nOperations Pty Ltd, for its 16.6% interest, adjusted for a net debt and working capital adjustment and an adjustment for the net cash inflows\nof HVO since 1 September 2017.\n\n\nYancoal will also receive from Glencore a 27.9% share of the US$240 million non-contingent royalties payable by Yancoal to Rio Tinto Plc\n(“Rio Tinto”) resulting from the acquisition of Coal & Allied Industries Ltd, which occurred on 1 September 2017.

Any adjustments to the provisional values\nas a result of completing work on the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired will be recognised within 12 months of the acquisition date and\nwill be recognised as if they had occurred as at the date of acquisition.\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** ANNUAL REPORT 2018 **149**\n\n\n(iii) Revenue and profit contribution\nThe acquired interest contributed revenue of $285 million and net profit of $137 million to the Group for the period from 1 March 2018 to\n31 December 2018. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2018, consolidated revenue and net profit before tax for the period ended\n31 December 2018 would have been $333 million and $160 million respectively. These amounts have been calculated using the Group’s\naccounting policies.\n\n\n**(d) Update on acquisition of Coal & Allied Industries Ltd**\nOn 1 September 2017, the Group acquired the shares in Coal & Allied from wholly owned subsidiaries of Rio Tinto. The total consideration\npayable was $3,547 million. The accounting for the Coal & Allied acquisition was determined on a provisional basis at 31 December 2017.\n\n\nDuring the current year, adjustments have been made to the provisional acquisition accounting of Coal & Allied. This resulted in an increase\nin provisions of $8 million offset by increases in mining tenements of $1 million and intangible assets of $1 million together with the resulting\ndeferred tax impacts. Deferred tax assets increased by $2 million and deferred tax liabilities decreased by $4 million. The changes have resulted\nfrom further analysis of agreements and the nature and status of assets that existed as at the acquisition date that, if known, would have\naffected the measurement of the amounts recognised as at the date of acquisition.\n\nThe accounting for the acquisition is now final as at 31 December 2018.\n\n\n**E2 INTERESTS IN OTHER ENTITIES**\n\n\n**Accounting Policies**\n(i) Associates\nAssociates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control or joint control, generally accompanying a\nshareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of\naccounting, after initially being recognised at cost. The Group’s investments in associates include goodwill identified on acquisition.\n\nThe Group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in profit or loss, and its share of post-acquisition\nother comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted\nagainst the carrying amount of the investment. Dividends receivable from associates are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount\nof the investment.\n\n\n(ii) Joint arrangements\nA joint arrangement is a contractual arrangement whereby two or more parties undertake economic activities under joint control. Joint\ncontrol exists only when the strategic, financial and operational policy decisions relating to the activities of the joint arrangement require the\nunanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\n\nA joint arrangement is either a joint operation or a joint venture. The structure of each joint arrangement is analysed to determine whether\nthe joint arrangement is a joint operation or a joint venture. The classification of a joint arrangement is dependent on the rights and\nobligations of the parties to the arrangement.\n\n\n_Joint operations_\nThe Group recognises its proportional right to the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations and its share of any\njointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These have been incorporated in the financial statements under the\nappropriate headings.\n\n\n_Joint ventures_\n\nA joint venture is structured through a separate vehicle and the parties have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Joint ventures\nare accounted for using the equity method where the assets and liabilities will be aggregated into one line item on the face of the\nconsolidated balance sheet, after adjusting for the share of profit or loss after tax, which is shown as a separate line item on the face of\nthe Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income, after adjusting for amounts recognised directly in equity.\n\n\n_Investments in associates and joint ventures_\nWhen the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture or associate equals or exceeds its interest in the joint venture or associate (which\nincludes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the joint venture), the Group does not\nrecognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture or associate.\n\n\nUnrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures or associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest\nin the joint ventures or associates. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the\nasset transferred. Accounting policies of the joint ventures or associates have been changed where necessary, to ensure consistency with\nthe policies adopted by the Group.\n\n\n**Critical accounting judgements**\nThere is significant judgement in assessing whether the Group controls Watagan; even though it holds 100% of the nominal share capital.\nAn assessment has been made that in accordance with the accounting standards the Group does not control Watagan as it is not able to\ndirect the relevant activities of Watagan and accounts for its interest in Watagan as an associate.\n\n\n**150** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** (CONTINUED)\n\n\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018\n\n\n**E – GROUP STRUCTURE**\n\n\n**E2 INTERESTS IN OTHER ENTITIES (CONTINUED)**\n\n\n**(a) Joint operations**\nA controlled entity, Moolarben Coal Mines Pty Limited, has an 85% (2017: 81%) interest in the Moolarben Joint Venture whose principal activity\nis the development and operation of open-cut and underground coal mines.\n\n\nA controlled entity, Coal & Allied Operations Pty Ltd, has a 51% (2017: 67.6%) interest in the Hunter Valley Operations Joint Venture whose\nprincipal activity is the development and operation of open cut coal mines.\n\n\nA controlled entity, Mount Thorley Operations Pty Ltd, has an 80% (2017: 80%) interest in the Mount Thorley Joint Venture whose principal\nactivity is the development and operation of open cut coal mines.\n\n\nControlled entities, CNA Warkworth Associates Pty Ltd and CNA Resources Ltd, have a combined 84.5% (2017: 55.6%) interest in the\nWarkworth Joint Venture whose principal activity is the development and operation of open cut coal mines.\n\n\nA controlled entity, Yarrabee Coal Company Pty Ltd, has a 50% (2017: 50%) interest in the Boonal Joint Venture, whose principal activity\nis the provision of a coal haul road and train load-out facility.\n\n\nThe principal place of business for the above joint operations is in Australia.\n\n\n**(b) Interests in associates and joint ventures**\nSet out below are the associates and joint ventures of the Group as at 31 December 2018.

On 18 February 2016, the\nGroup executed a Bond Subscription Agreement, together with other agreements (the “Watagan Agreements”) that, on completion, transferred\nthe Group’s interest in three of its 100% owned NSW coal mining operations, being the Austar, Ashton and Donaldson coal mines (the “three\nmines”), to Watagan for a purchase price of $1,363.4 million (an amount equal to the book value of the three mines at completion). The purchase\nprice was funded by way of a $1,363.4 million loan from Yancoal Australia Ltd to Watagan bearing interest at BBSY plus 7.06% with a maturity\ndate of 1 April 2025. The outstanding interest and principal of this loan is guaranteed by Yankuang Group Co., Ltd (“Yankuang”), the Group’s\nultimate parent entity. The completion date of the transaction was 31 March 2016.\n\nOn completion Watagan issued US$775 million of secured debt bonds with a term of approximately nine years to three external financiers\n(“Bondholders”). The Bondholders receive interest on the face value outstanding on the bonds comprising a fixed interest component, as well as\na variable interest component that is tied to the EBITDA performance of Watagan. As a result of the terms of the Watagan Agreements, it was\ndetermined that the Bondholders obtained accounting control of Watagan; accordingly, the Group de-consolidated Watagan.\n\n\nThis change in accounting control was determined to occur on the issuance date of the bonds on the basis that the Bondholders obtained\npower over the key operating and strategic decisions of Watagan and no longer resided with the Group. Specifically, those powers were\ntransferred to the Bondholders under the terms of the Watagan Agreements as the Bondholders were given control of Watagan’s Board of\nDirectors via appointment of the majority of Directors. This change in accounting control resulted in the Group de-consolidating the results of\nWatagan from the transaction completion date and the Group began to equity account for its 100% equity interest in Watagan as an associate,\ngiven the Group retains significant influence in Watagan.\n\nOn 4 January 2019 BOCI (one of the Bondholders) notified Watagan and Yankuang that it was exercising its put option over US$200 million\nof bonds. As a consequence, Yankuang will become the bondholder of the put bonds following completion of the purchase of those bonds\nby Yankuang expected to occur on or around 1 April 2019. No security will be given by Watagan in favour of Yankuang. As the put bonds\nrepresent less than 50.1% of the face value of the bonds, and the put option was not exercised by the instructing bondholder, the put option\nis not deemed to have been exercised as to all the bonds, nor has the Group regained accounting control of Watagan. Accordingly, the Group\ncontinues to equity account its interest in Watagan.\n\n\nWhilst Watagan is equity accounted rather than consolidated for accounting purposes, as a result of the Group’s ongoing 100% equity\nownership it remains within the Group’s tax consolidated group.\n\n\nThe book value of Watagan’s net assets has declined since inception\nand at 31 December 2018 the book value of liabilities exceeded\nthe book value of assets by $438 million. These losses have not\nbeen recognised as the accumulated losses exceed the value of the\ninvestment by the Group.\n\n\nThe book value of Watagan’s non-current assets of $1,654 million\nincludes $743 million, $390 million and $388 million for the Ashton,\nAustar and Donaldson mines, respectively.\n\n\nAs noted in the Directors’ Report Austar was subject to prohibition\nnotices issued by the Resource Regulator that restricted current\noperations in Bellbird South, however as announced on 7 August\n2018 these notices have now been lifted. Ongoing work is being\nundertaken by Watagan in respect of the very challenging geological\nand geotechnical conditions at the Austar mine, including both the\nBellbird South and Stage 3 areas that may have a significant adverse\nimpact on future commercial operations. The future prospects of the\nAustar mine are therefore uncertain, and its future carrying value will\ndepend upon the work currently being conducted by Watagan and\nits internal and external advisors ( **Austar Review** ). If it is determined\nthat the mine is unable to return to previously forecast levels of\nproduction, there is a need to proceed to a permanent shutdown, or\nthere are materially negative changes to other operating assumptions,\nincluding coal prices, exchange rates, operating costs or capital\nexpenditure, it is likely that the fair value of that mine, and therefore\nof Watagan, would be reduced materially. In that event, a material\nimpairment charge may be recognised. Donaldson remains on care\nand maintenance and work remains ongoing to explore potential\nfuture mining operations.\n\n\nThe value of the non-current assets in the Watagan balance sheet has\nthus been assessed on an aggregated basis, including that:\n\n\n–– Austar returns to normal development and production in the Stage\n3 area on completion of mining in Bellbird South, this position will\nhave to be reassessed on completion of the Austar Review; and\n\n\n–– Donaldson will recommence operations at some time in the future\nwhich is management’s current intention.\n\n\nThe key assumptions in the fair value model of Watagan are\nconsistent with those disclosed in Note C3 noting that: (i) the Group’s\nassessment of the long-term coal prices of USD67 – USD125 per\ntonne for thermal coal and USD112 – USD150 per tonne from\nmetallurgical coal for Watagan mines is at the top of the range of\nexternal forecasts; and (ii) to reflect the increased operational risks\nwhen determining the recoverable amount of the Watagan mines a\n3.5% risk premium has been applied to the discount rate, increasing\nto 14%.\n\n\nIf it is determined that either or both Austar or Donaldson are\nunable to restart operations or return to previously forecast levels of\nproduction or there are materially negative changes to other operating\nassumptions, impacting all three mines, including coal prices,\nexchange rates, operating costs, capital expenditure, geological\nconditions, approvals or changes to existing lease conditions or\nregulatory outcomes, it is likely that the fair value of these mines would\nbe reduced materially. Any impairment of these assets of Watagan\nwould increase Watagan’s net asset deficit.\n\n\nIn that event, an impairment may be recognised by the Group on its\nloan receivable from Watagan; refer to Note D1 for details on the loan,\nor on the future reconsolidation of Watagan.\n\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** ANNUAL REPORT 2018 **151**\n\n\n_Sensitivities_\n\nApart from the geological and geotechnical issues noted at Austar and\nthe ongoing work on recommencing mining at Donaldson that directly\nimpact the physical and cost inputs, the most sensitive input to the\nfair value model of Watagan is forecast revenue, which is primarily\ndependent on estimated future coal prices and the AUD:USD forecast\nexchange rate, and the discount rate.\n\n\n**2018**\n\n**Watagan**\n\n**$M**\n\n\nBook Value 1,046\n\nRecoverable Amount 1,073\n\nHead Room 27\n\n\nUS$ Coal Price (i)\n\n+10% 371\n\n–10% (373)\n\n\nExchange Rate (ii)\n+5 cents (228)\n\n–5 cents 269\n\n\nDiscount Rate (iii)\n\n+50 bps (52)\n\n–50 bps 55\n\n\n(i) \u0007This represents change in recoverable amount due to +/– 10%\n\nchange to our coal price assumption.\n\n\n(ii) \u0007This represents the change in recoverable amount due to a\n\n+/– 5 cents change to the long-term US$:A$ foreign exchange\nrate adopted.\n\n\n(iii) \u0007This represents the change in recoverable amount due to a\n\n+/– 50bps change in discount rate adopted.\n\n\n_Port Waratah Coal Services Ltd_\n\nThe Group holds a direct shareholding in Port Waratah Coal Services\nLtd (“PWCS”) of 30% (2017: 30%).

The final dividend will be paid on 30 April 2019.\n\n\n–– As announced 25 February 2019, Yancoal pre-paid a further\nUS$500 million in loans, reducing its total debt liabilities by\nUS$1.4 billion since September 2017. The pre-payment consists\nof US$250 million in pre-paid loans from Bank of China and China\nConstruction Bank, and US$250 million in pre-paid Yanzhourelated loans.\n\n\n**F6 OTHER SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**\n\n\n**(a) Foreign currency transactions**\n(i) Functional and presentation currency\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s\nentities are measured using the currency of the primary economic\nenvironment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”).\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in Australian\ndollars, which is the Group’s functional and presentation currency,\nexcept for Yancoal SCN Limited which has US dollars as its\nfunctional currency.\n\nFor the purpose of presenting these consolidated financial statements,\nthe assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are\ntranslated into Australian dollars using exchange rates prevailing at the\nend of the reporting period. Income and expense items are translated\nat the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates\nfluctuated significantly during that period, in which case the exchange\nrates at the dates of the transactions are used. Exchange differences\narising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and\naccumulated in equity.\n\n\n(ii) Transactions and balances\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional\ncurrency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the\ntransactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the\nsettlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end\nexchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in\nforeign currencies are recognised in profit or loss, except when they\nare deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges.\n\n\nNon-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign\ncurrency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when\nthe fair value was determined. Translation differences on assets and\nliabilities carried at fair value are reported as part of the fair value gain\nor loss. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical\ncost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at\nthe date of the transaction.\n\n\n**(b) Financial instruments**\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when a Group\nentity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair\nvalue. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition\nor issue of financial assets and financial liabilities are added to\nor deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial\nliabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition.\n\n\n\n(i) Financial assets\nAll regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognised\nand derecognised on a trade date basis. Regular way purchases or\nsales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of\nassets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in\nthe marketplace.\n\nAll recognised financial assets are subsequently measured in their\nentirety at either amortised cost or fair value, depending on the\nclassification of the financial assets.\n\n\n**Classification of financial assets**\nDebt instruments that meet the following conditions are subsequently\nmeasured at amortised cost:\n\n–– the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective\nis to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows;\nand\n\n–– the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified\ndates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and\ninterest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\n\n**Amortised cost and effective interest method**\n\nThe effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised\ncost of a debt instrument and of allocating interest income over the\nrelevant period.\n\nFor financial instruments the effective interest rate is the rate that\nexactly discounts estimated future cash receipts (including all fees\nand points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective\ninterest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts)\nexcluding ECL, through the expected life of the debt instrument, or,\nwhere appropriate, a shorter period, to the gross carrying amount of\nthe debt instrument on initial recognition.\n\nThe amortised cost of a financial asset is the amount at which the\nfinancial asset is measured at initial recognition minus the principal\nrepayments, plus the cumulative amortisation using the effective\ninterest method of any difference between that initial amount and the\nmaturity amount, adjusted for any loss allowance. On the other hand,\nthe gross carrying amount of a financial asset is the amortised cost of\na financial asset before adjusting for any loss allowance.\n\n\nInterest income is recognised using the effective interest method\nfor debt instruments measured subsequently at amortised cost.\nFor financial instruments interest income is calculated by applying\nthe effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of a financial\nasset, except for financial assets that have subsequently become\ncredit-impaired. For financial assets that have subsequently become\ncredit-impaired, interest income is recognised by applying the\neffective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset. If, in\nsubsequent reporting periods, the credit risk on the credit-impaired\nfinancial instrument improves so that the financial asset is no longer\ncredit-impaired, interest income is recognised by applying the effective\ninterest rate to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset.\n\nInterest income is recognised in profit or loss and is included in the\n“other revenue” line item.\n\n\n**Financial assets at FVTPL**\n\nFinancial assets that do not meet the criteria for being measured at\namortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income\n(”FVTOCI”) are measured at FVTPL. Specifically:\n\n–– Investments in equity instruments are classified as at FVTPL,\nunless the Group designates an equity investment that is neither\nheld for trading nor contingent consideration arising from a\nbusiness combination as at FVTOCI on initial recognition.\n\n\n–– Debt instruments that do not meet the amortised cost criteria\nor the FVTOCI criteria are classified as at FVTPL. In addition,\ndebt instruments that meet either the amortised cost criteria or\nthe FVTOCI criteria may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial\nrecognition if such designation eliminates or significantly reduces\na measurement or recognition inconsistency that would arise from\nmeasuring assets or liabilities or recognising the gains and losses\non them on different bases. The Group has not designated any\ndebt instruments as at FVTPL.\n\n\nFinancial assets at FVTPL are measured at fair value, with changes\nin fair value arising from remeasurement recognised in profit or loss.\nThe net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss excludes any dividend\nor interest earned on the financial assets and is included in the “Other\nincome” line item.\n\n\n**Significant increase in credit risk**\nIn assessing whether the credit risk on a financial instrument has\nincreased significantly since initial recognition, the Group compares\nthe risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument as at the\nreporting date with the risk of a default occurring on the financial\ninstrument as at the date of initial recognition. In making this\nassessment, the Group considers both quantitative and qualitative\ninformation that is reasonable and supportable, including historical\nexperience and forward-looking information that is available without\nundue cost or effort. Forward-looking information considered\nincludes the future prospects of the industries in which the Group’s\ndebtors operate, obtained from economic expert reports, financial\nanalysts, governmental bodies, relevant think-tanks and other similar\norganisations, as well as consideration of various external sources of\nactual and forecast economic information that relate to the Group’s\ncore operations.\n\n\nIn particular, the following information is taken into account when\nassessing whether credit risk has increased significantly since\ninitial recognition:\n\n–– an actual or expected significant deterioration in the financial\ninstrument’s external (if available) or internal credit rating;\n\n–– significant deterioration in external market indicators of credit risk\nfor a particular financial instrument, e.g. a significant increase in the\ncredit spread, the credit default swap prices for the debtor, or the\nlength of time or the extent to which the fair value of a financial\nasset has been less than its amortised cost;\n\n–– existing or forecast adverse changes in business, financial or\neconomic conditions that are expected to cause a significant\ndecrease in the debtor’s ability to meet its debt obligations;\n\n–– an actual or expected significant deterioration in the operating\nresults of the debtor;\n\n–– significant increases in credit risk on other financial instruments\nof the same debtor; and\n\n–– an actual or expected significant adverse change in the regulatory,\neconomic or technological environment of the debtor that\nresults in a significant decrease in the debtor’s ability to meet\nits debt obligations.\n\n\nIrrespective of the outcome of the above assessment, the Group\npresumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased\nsignificantly since initial recognition when contractual payments are\nmore than 30 days past due, unless the Group has reasonable and\nsupportable information that demonstrates otherwise.\n\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** ANNUAL REPORT 2018 **165**\n\n\nDespite the foregoing, the Group assumes that the credit risk on\na financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial\nrecognition if the financial instrument is determined to have low credit\nrisk at the reporting date. A financial instrument is determined to have\nlow credit risk if i) the financial instrument has a low risk of default, ii)\nthe borrower has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow\nobligations in the near term and iii) adverse changes in economic and\nbusiness conditions in the longer term may, but will not necessarily,\nreduce the ability of the borrower to fulfil its contractual cash flow\nobligations. The Group considers a financial asset to have low credit\nrisk when it has an internal or external credit rating of “investment\ngrade” as per globally understood definition.\n\n\nThe Group regularly monitors the effectiveness of the criteria used to\nidentify whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk and\nrevises them as appropriate to ensure that the criteria are capable\nof identifying significant increase in credit risk before the amount\nbecomes past due.\n\n\n**Definition of default**\nThe Group considers the following as constituting an event of default\nfor internal credit risk management purposes as historical experience\nindicates that receivables that meet either of the following criteria are\ngenerally not recoverable:\n\n–– when there is a breach of financial covenants by the counterparty;\n\nor\n\n\n–– information developed internally or obtained from external sources\nindicates that the debtor is unlikely to pay its creditors, including\nthe Group, in full (without taking into account any collaterals held\nby the Group).\n\n\nIrrespective of the above analysis, the Group considers that default\nhas occurred when a financial asset is more than 90 days past due\nunless the Group has reasonable and supportable information to\ndemonstrate that a more lagging default criterion is more appropriate.\n\n\n**Credit-impaired financial assets**\nA financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that\nhave a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of\nthat financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is\ncredit‑impaired includes observable data about the following events:\n\na) significant financial difficulty of the issuer or the borrower;\n\n\nb) a breach of contract, such as a default or past due event;\n\n\nc) \u0007the lender(s) of the borrower, for economic or contractual reasons\n\nrelating to the borrower’s financial difficulty, having granted to the\nborrower a concession(s) that the lender(s) would not otherwise\nconsider; or\n\n\nd) \u0007it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter into\n\nbankruptcy or other financial reorganisation.\n\n\n**Measurement and recognition of ECL**\nThe measurement of ECL is a function of the probability of default,\nloss given default (i.e. the magnitude of the loss if there is a default)\nand the exposure at default. The assessment of the probability of\ndefault and loss given default is based on historical data adjusted by\nforward-looking information as described above. As for the exposure\nat default, for financial assets, this is represented by the assets’ gross\ncarrying amount at the reporting date.\n\nFor financial assets, the ECL is estimated as the difference between all\ncontractual cash flows that are due to the Group in accordance with\nthe contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive,\ndiscounted at the original effective interest rate.\n\n\n**166** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** (CONTINUED)\n\n\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018\n\n\n**F – OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n\n\n**F6 OTHER SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**\n\n\n**(b) Financial instruments (continued)**\n(i) Financial assets (continued)\n_Measurement and recognition of ECL (continued)_\n\nWhere lifetime ECL is measured on a collective basis to cater for\ncases where evidence of significant increases in credit risk at the\nindividual instrument level may not yet be available, the financial\ninstruments are grouped on the following basis:\n\n–– nature of financial instruments;\n\n\n–– past-due status;\n\n\n–– nature, size and industry of debtors; and\n\n\n–– external credit ratings where available.\n\n\nThe grouping is regularly reviewed by management to ensure\nthe constituents of each group continue to share similar credit\nrisk characteristics.\n\nIf the Group has measured the loss allowance for a financial\ninstrument at an amount equal to lifetime ECL in the previous\nreporting period, but determines at the current reporting date that the\nconditions for lifetime ECL are no longer met, the Group measures the\nloss allowance at an amount equal to 12-month ECL at the current\nreporting date.\n\nThe Group recognises an impairment gain or loss in profit or loss\nfor all financial instruments with a corresponding adjustment to their\ncarrying amount through a loss allowance account.\n\n\n**Impairment of trade receivables**\nThe Group has applied the simplified approach to measuring expected\ncredit losses to trade and other receivables using a lifetime expected\nloss allowance. The Group has also used the practical expedient of a\nprovisions matrix using fixed rates to approximate the expected credit\nlosses. These provisions are considered representative across all\nbusiness and geographic segments of the Group based on historical\ncredit loss experience and considered future information.\n\n\n(ii) Financial liabilities and equity instruments\nDebt and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified as\neither financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance\nof the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial\nliability and an equity instrument.\n\n\nAn equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest\nin the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.\n\n\n**Financial liabilities**\nThe Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables,\nnon-contingent royalty payable, and interest-bearing liabilities which\nare initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at\namortised cost, using the effective interest method.\n\n\n_Effective interest method_\n\nThe effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised\ncost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the\nrelevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly\ndiscounts estimated future cash payments (including all fees paid\nor points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective\ninterest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts)\nthrough the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate,\na shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.\nInterest expense is recognised on an effective interest basis.\n\n\n\n_Equity instruments_\nAn equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest\nin the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity\ninstruments issued by the Company are recognised at the proceeds\nreceived, net of direct issue costs.\n\n\nSCNs issued by the Group, which include no contractual obligation\nfor the Group to deliver cash or another financial asset to the holders\nor to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with the holders\nunder conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group,\nare classified as equity instruments and are initially recorded at the\nproceeds received.\n\n\n**Accounting for derivative financial instruments and**\n**hedging activities**\nDerivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date when a\nderivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at\ntheir fair value at the end of the reporting period. The resulting gain or\nloss is recognised in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is\ndesignated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the\ntiming of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the\nhedge relationship. The Group designates certain derivatives as either:\n(i) hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities (fair value\nhedges); or (ii) hedges of highly probable forecast transactions (cash\nflow hedges).\n\n\nThe fair values of various derivative instruments used for hedging\npurposes are disclosed in Note D9. The full fair value of a hedging\nderivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the\nremaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months and as\na current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged\nitem is less than 12 months.\n\n\nAt the inception of the hedging relationship the Group documents\nthe relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged\nitem, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for\nundertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception\nof the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether\nthe hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly\neffective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the\nhedged item.\n\n\n_(i) Cash flow hedge_\nThe effective portions of changes in the fair value of derivatives that\nare designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised\nin other comprehensive income and accumulated in cash flow\nhedge reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion\nis recognised immediately in profit or loss.\n\n\nAmounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and\naccumulated in cash flow hedge reserve in equity are reclassified to\nprofit or loss in the periods when the hedged items are recognised\nin profit or loss.\n\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the\nhedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold,\nterminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge\naccounting. Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive\nincome and accumulated in equity at that time remains in equity and\nis recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised\nin profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected\nto occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised\nimmediately in profit or loss.\n\n\n_(ii) Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting and those not_\n_designated as hedging instruments_\nChanges in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not\nqualify for hedge accounting and those not designated as hedges are\nrecognised immediately in profit or loss.\n\n\n**Derecognition**\nA financial asset is derecognised only when the contractual rights to\nthe cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial\nasset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the\nasset to another entity.\n\nOn derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference\nbetween the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the\nconsideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or\nloss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income and\naccumulated in investment revaluation reserve is recognised in profit\nor loss.\n\nA financial liability is derecognised when, and only when, the Group’s\nobligations are discharged, cancelled or expire. The difference\nbetween the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and\nthe consideration paid and payable is recognised in profit or loss.\n\n\n**F7 NEW AND AMENDED STANDARDS ADOPTED BY THE GROUP**\n\n\n**(i) New and amended standards adopted by the Group**\nEffective from 1 January 2018 the Group adopted the new standards\nincluding AASB 9 _Financial Instruments_ and AASB 15 _Revenue from_\n_Contracts with Customers_ . The impact of adopting these standards is\nas follows:\n\n\nAASB 9 _Financial Instruments_\n\nThe adoption of AASB 9 _Financial Instruments_ resulted in the\nfollowing changes:\n\n\n**Financial Assets**\nAll financial assets that were classified as loans and receivables were\nclassified as assets held at amortised cost except for the Wiggins\nIsland Preferences Shares (“WIPS”) which have been revalued to nil\nat 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: $29 million). These have\nbeen reclassified as assets held at fair value through profit or loss\n(“FVTPL”). The valuation at 31 December 2017 did not need adjusting\nas the fair value approximated the carrying amount. The WIPS are still\nclassified as trade and other receivables.\n\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** ANNUAL REPORT 2018 **167**\n\n\n**Financial Liabilities**\nClassification of financial liabilities remains the same as under the old\naccounting standards. The measurement of financial liabilities has\nrequired an adjustment to non-current interest-bearing liabilities as\nthere was a non-substantial modification to the Bank of China facilities\ncompleted in August 2017. This involved modifying the terms of this\nloan to change the interest structure from US Libor +2.8% increasing\nto US Libor +5% over time, adjusted to US Libor +3.1% applicable\nfrom June 2017 and adjustments to agency fees over the remaining\nloan life.\n\nUnder AASB 9, a key determinant of whether a modification is\nconsidered substantial or non-substantial is a quantitative assessment\nof whether the discounted cash flows under the new terms, using\nthe original effective interest rate, is at least 10% different from the\ndiscounted remaining cash flows of the original financial liability.\n\nQualitatively the modification is non-substantial because there has\nbeen no change in the counterparty to the loan and a quantitative\nassessment has been performed. The modification in 2017 is nonsubstantial, or less than 10% of the net present value of the original\nloan balance, with the net present value of the changes being a\n$31 million reduction in cash flows or 0.9% over the life of the loan.\nThis adjustment is recognised as a gain in other income and will be\nunwound as an interest expense on an effective interest rate basis\nwith immediate unwinds occurring on loan repayments. The unwind\nfor the year ending 31 December 2017 would have been $7 million\nwhich included an immediate unwind associated with the repayment\nof US$150 million of the facilities in December 2017.\n\n\nAs the Group is applying AASB 9 retrospectively with the cumulative\neffect of initially applying the standard as an adjustment to the opening\nbalance of retained earnings, accordingly comparative financial\ninformation is not being restated. The adjustment to the balance\nsheet and profit or loss for the year ended 31 December 2017 is\noutlined below:\n\n\n\n**Opening balance**\n\n**1 January**\n\n**2018**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**As reported**\n**31 December**\n\n\n**2017**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Non-substantial**\n\n\n**loan**\n**modification**\n\n**$M**\n\n\n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\nNon-current interest bearing liabilities 4,706 (24) 4,682\n\nDeferred tax liability 1,030 7 1,037\n\nTotal liabilities impact 7,287 (17) 7,270\n\nNet asset impact 5,026 17 5,043\n\nAccumulated losses (413) 17 (396)\n\nTotal equity 5,026 17 5,043\n\n**Profit or loss**\n\nOther income 294 31 325\n\nFinance costs (287) (7) (294)\n\nIncome tax expense (82) (7) (89)\nProfit after income tax 229 17 246\n\nTotal comprehensive income 633 17 650\n\n\nBasic earnings per share (cents per share) 52.0 55.8\nDiluted earnings per share (cents per share) 28.0 30.1\n\n\n**168** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** (CONTINUED)\n\n\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018\n\n\n**F – OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n\n**F7 NEW AND AMENDED STANDARDS ADOPTED BY THE GROUP (CONTINUED)**\n\n\n**(i) New and amended standards adopted by the Group (continued)**\n\nAASB 15 _Revenue from Contracts with Customers_\n\nThe updated accounting policies for the new accounting standard AASB 15 _Revenue from Contracts with Customers_ have been disclosed\nin Note B2(a) and the presentation has been updated to reflect the disclosure requirements of the new standard.\n\nThere is one additional category of revenue being recognised for freight services; this will change the revenue reported from coal sales in the\n31 December 2017 period from $2,635 million to $2,623 million with the corresponding difference of $12 million being recognised as freight\nservices in other revenue. There is no adjustment required to opening retained earnings as the timing or value of revenue recognised on\ncontracts with customers has not changed.\n\n\n**Other amending accounting standards and interpretations**\nOther relevant accounting standards and amendments and interpretations effective for the current reporting period include:\n\n–– AASB 2016-5 _Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions_ ; and\n\n–– AASB Interpretation 22 _Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration._\n\n\nThese standards have introduced new disclosures for the Annual Financial Report but did not affect the Group’s accounting policies or any of the\namounts recognised in the financial statements.\n\n\n**F8 NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS**\n\nCertain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for 31 December 2018 reporting periods and\nhave not been early adopted by the Group. The Group’s assessment of the impact of these new standards and interpretations is set out below.\n\n\n\n**Reference** **Application date**\n**and Title** **Details of New Standard/Amendment/Interpretation** **for the Group**\n\n\nAASB 16 _Leases_ 1 January 2019\n\nThe Group is required to adopt AASB 16 _Leases_ from 1 January 2019. The Group has assessed the estimated\nimpact that initial application of AASB 16 will have on its consolidated financial statements, as described below.\nThe actual impacts of adopting the standard on 1 January 2019 may change because:\na) the Group has not finalised the testing and assessment of controls over its new IT systems; and\nb) \u0007the new accounting policies are subject to change until the Group presents its first financial statements that\n\ninclude the date of initial application.\n\nAASB 16 introduces a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees. A lessee recognises a\nright-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation\nto make lease payments. There are recognition exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low-value items.\nLessor accounting remains similar to the current standard – i.e. lessors continue to classify leases as finance or\noperating leases.\n\nAASB 16 replaces existing leases guidance, including AASB 117 _Leases_, IFRIC 4 _Determining whether an_\n_Arrangement contains a Lease_, SIC-15 _Operating Leases – Incentives_ and SIC-27 _Evaluating the Substance_\n_of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease_ .\nThe Group plans to apply AASB 16 initially on 1 January 2019, using the modified retrospective approach.\nThe Group plans to apply the practical expedient to grandfather the definition of a lease on transition. This\nmeans that it will apply AASB 16 to all contracts entered into before 1 January 2019 and identified as leases\nin accordance with AASB 117 and IFRIC 4.\n\nImpact:\n\n_Leases in which the Group is a lessee_\n\nThe Group will recognise new assets and liabilities for its operating leases. The nature of expenses related to\nthose leases will now change because the Group will recognise a depreciation charge for right-of-use assets\nand interest expense on lease liabilities.\n\nPreviously, the Group recognised operating lease expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease,\nand recognised assets and liabilities only to the extent that there was a timing difference between actual lease\npayments and the expense recognised.\nNo significant impact is expected for the Group’s finance leases.\n\nBased on the information currently available, the Group estimates that it will recognise additional lease liabilities\nof $111 million and right-of-use assets of $92 million as at 1 January 2019. The Group does not expect\nthe adoption of AASB 16 to impact its ability to comply with the revised maximum leverage threshold loan\ncovenants described in Note D2.\nAlthough the Directors anticipate that the adoption of AASB 16 will impact the Group’s financial statements,\nit is impracticable at this stage to provide a reasonable estimate of such impact.\n\n_Leases in which the Group is lessor_\nThe Group will reassess the classification of sub-leases in which the Group is a lessor. Based on the information\ncurrently available, the Group expects that it will reclassify sub-leases as finance leases, resulting in recognition\nof a finance lease receivable of $19 million as at 1 January 2019.\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** ANNUAL REPORT 2018 **169**\n\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n**and Title** **Details of New Standard/Amendment/Interpretation**\n\n\n\n**Reference** **Application date**\n**and Title** **Details of New Standard/Amendment/Interpretation** **for the Group**\n\n\nAASB 2017-6 _Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation_ 1 January 2019\n\n\n\n1 January 2019\n\n\n\nThis Standard amends AASB 9 _Financial Instruments_ to permit entities to measure at amortised cost or fair\nvalue through other comprehensive income particular financial assets that would otherwise have contractual\ncash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest but do not meet that condition only as a result of\na prepayment feature. This is subject to meeting other conditions, such as the nature of the business model\nrelevant to the financial asset. Otherwise, the financial assets would be measured at fair value through profit\nor loss. The Standard also clarifies in the Basis for Conclusion that, under AASB 9, gains and losses arising\non modifications of financial liabilities that do not result in derecognition should be recognised in profit or loss.\n\n\nImpact:\n\n\nThe Directors anticipate that the adoption of AASB 2017-6 will have no impact on the recognition of amounts\nin the Group’s financial statements, but there will be additional disclosures required.\n\n\nAASB 2017-7 _Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures_\n\n\nThis Standard amends AASB 128 _Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures_ to clarify that an entity is\nrequired to account for long-term interests in an associate or joint venture, which in substance form part of the\nnet investment in the associate or joint venture but to which the equity method is not applied, using AASB 9\n_Financial Instruments_ before applying the loss allocation and impairment requirements in AASB 128.\n\n\nImpact:\n\n\n\n1 January 2019\n\n\n\nThe Directors anticipate that the adoption of AASB 2017-7 will have no impact on the recognition of amounts in\nthe Group’s financial statements, but there will be additional disclosures required.\n\n\nAASB 2018-1 _Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2015- 2017 Cycle_ 1 January 2019\n\n\nThe amendments clarify certain requirements in:\n\n\na) IFRS 3 _Business Combinations_ and IFRS 11 _Joint Arrangements – previously held interest in a joint operation_ ;\n\nb) \u0007IAS 12 _Income Taxes – income tax consequences of payments on financial instruments classified as equity_ ;\n\nand\n\n\nc) IAS 23 _Borrowing Costs – borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation_ .\n\n\nImpact:\n\n\n\nAASB\nInterpretation\n23, and\nrelevant\namending\nstandards\n\n\nNot yet issued\nby the AASB\n\n\n\nThe Directors anticipate that the adoption of AASB 2018-1 will have no impact on the recognition of amounts in\nthe Group’s financial statements, but there will be additional disclosures required.\n\n\n_Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments_ 1 January 2019\n\nThe Interpretation clarifies the application of the recognition and measurement criteria in AASB 112 _Income_\n_Taxes_ when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments. The Interpretation specifically addresses\nthe following:\n\n\na) whether an entity considers uncertain tax treatments separately;\n\n\nb) the assumptions an entity makes about the examination of tax treatments by taxation authorities;\n\nc) \u0007how an entity determines taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and\n\ntax rates; and\n\n\nd) how an entity considers changes in facts and circumstances.\n\n\nThe Group is currently adhering to this standard and there is no material impact expected on the Group’s\nfinancial report.\n\n\n_Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting, and relevant amending standards_ 1 January 2020\n\nThe revised Conceptual Framework includes some new concepts, provides updated definitions and recognition\ncriteria for assets and liabilities and clarifies some important concepts. It is arranged in eight chapters,\nas follows:\n\n–– Chapter 1 – The objective of financial reporting\n\n–– Chapter 2 – Qualitative characteristics of useful financial information\n\n\n–– Chapter 3 – Financial statements and the reporting entity\n\n–– Chapter 4 – The elements of financial statements\n\n\n–– Chapter 5 – Recognition and derecognition\n\n\n–– Chapter 6 – Measurement\n\n\n–– Chapter 7 – Presentation and disclosure\n\n\n–– Chapter 8 – Concepts of capital and capital maintenance\n\n\n**170** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\n\n\n**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** (CONTINUED)\n\n\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018\n\n\n**F – OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n\n**F8 NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS (CONTINUED)**\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n**and Title** **Details of New Standard/Amendment/Interpretation**\n\n\n\n**Application date**\n**for the Group**\n\n\n\nNot yet issued\nby the AASB\n(continued)\n\n\n\n_Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards_ has also been issued, which sets\nout the amendments to affected standards in order to update references to the revised Conceptual Framework.\nThe changes to the Conceptual Framework may affect the application of IFRS in situations where no standard\napplies to a particular transaction or event. In addition, relief has been provided in applying IFRS 3 and\ndeveloping accounting policies for regulatory account balances using IAS 8, such that entities must continue to\napply the definitions of an asset and a liability (and supporting concepts) in the 2010 Conceptual Framework,\nand not the definitions in the revised Conceptual Framework.\n\n\nImpact:\n\n\nThe Directors anticipate that the adoption of these updates will have no impact on the recognition of amounts\nin the Group’s financial statements, but there will be additional disclosures required.\n\n\n\nAASB 2014-10 _Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and_\n\n_its Associate or Joint Venture_\n\n\n\n1 January 2022\n\n\n\nThe amendments clarify that a full gain or loss is recognised when a transfer to an associate or joint venture\ninvolves a business as defined in AASB 3 _Business Combinations_ .

The maximum annual transaction amount to be\ndistributed by the MT SalesCo to POSCO for the three years ending\n31 December 2018, 2019 and 2020 will not exceed US$90 million,\nUS$90 million and US$90 million, respectively. During the year ended\n31 December 2018, the transaction amount distributed by the MT\nSalesCo to POSCO was approximately US$89.5 million, which was\nbelow the annual cap.\n\n\n**Review on continuing connected transactions**\nPursuant to Rule 14A.55 of the HK Listing Rules, the Directors\n(including Independent Non-Executive Directors) have reviewed\nthe above continuing connected transactions in the year ended\n31 December 2018.

Pursuant to a long-term\nmanagement services agreement, the Company is responsible for,\namong others, HR, treasury and the operations, exploration and\ndevelopment of the Managed Mines.\n\n\nThe Directors are of the view that the connected transaction\nentered into with the Yanzhou Group as described above will\n\n\n\nnot have any material impact on the Group’s ability to operate\nindependently and the Group’s operations are independent from\nthe Controlling Shareholders.\n\n\n**Financial Independence**\nAs at 31 December 2018, except for the guarantee provided by\nYankuang in respect of the obligations of Watagan (a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of the Company) under a loan facility agreement between\nthe Company and Watagan, of which A$835 million remained drawn\ndown, there are no loans or guarantees which are provided by the\nYankuang Group to or for the benefit of the Group.\n\n\nSince 31 December 2018, the Company has not drawn down or\nutilised any of the loan facilities or guarantees mentioned above\nand has no intention to further draw down on such loan facilities\nor guarantees before the Listing.\n\nThe Group has obtained financing from third party sources on a\nstand-alone basis without any credit support from the Yanzhou Group\nor the Yankuang Group or any of their respective associates. The\nDirectors are therefore of the view that the Group is able to operate\nfinancially independently from the Controlling Shareholders.\n\n\n**COMMUNICATION WITH SHAREHOLDERS**\n\n\nThe Company believes in high standards of transparent corporate\ndisclosure and is committed to disclose, to its shareholders,\n\n\n**184** YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD\n\n\n**ADDITIONAL HKEx COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS** (CONTINUED)\n\n\n\ninformation in a timely and fair manner via ASX and HKExnews.\nWhere there is inadvertent disclosure made to a selected group,\nthe Company will make the same disclosure publicly to all others\nas soon as practicable.

The Company obtained a waiver under Rule 8.08(1)(d)\nof the Hong Kong Listing Rules to accept a lower public float\npercentage and the Company’s minimum public float is approximately\n15.37%. Due to an inadvertent oversight, the minimum public float\npercentage was incorrectly stated as approximately 15.39% (instead\nof 15.37%) in the Company’s announcement of the partial exercise of\nthe over-allotment option dated 31 December 2018.\n\n\nBased on the information that is publicly available to the Company\nand within the knowledge of the Directors as at the date of this\nreport, the Company has maintained the minimum public float of\napproximately 15.37% under the HK Listing Rules.\n\n\n**FULFILMENT OF CONDITIONS AND UNDERTAKINGS**\n\nThe Company confirms that it has complied with the conditions and\nundertakings imposed by The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited\nduring the period from 6 December 2018 (the date on which dealings\nin the Shares were permitted to take place on the Main Board of the\nHKEx in Hong Kong) to 31 December 2018.\n\n\n**USE OF IPO PROCEEDS**\n\n\nIn connection with the global offering in Hong Kong, which was\ncompleted on 3 January 2019 (the “ **Global Offering** ”), the Company\nallotted and issued 59,441,900 new shares on 6 December 2018,\n563,881 new shares on 28 December 2018 and 4,361,900 new\nshares on 3 January 2019 at a price of HK$23.48 per share and\nraised HK$1,511 million (A$268 million) in total gross proceeds.
