OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Yancoal’s operations produced a record
50.0 million tonnes saleable coal for 2018,
up 59% on the year prior, with the Moolarben
complex achieving a new annual total saleable
coal production record of 16.5 million tonnes,
up 33% on the year prior.
The Mount Thorley Warkworth and Hunter Valley
Operations mines produced annual totals of 12.1
million tonnes and 13.3 million tonnes respectively.
The three tier-one assets led an increase in total
attributable coal sales of 68% on the year prior,
with Yancoal achieving total sales of 37.1 million
tonnes in 2018, up from 22.1 million tonnes in 2017.
Thermal coal sales were up 88% on the prior year,
supported by increased market demand and
tier-one production rates, achieving a FY2018 total
of 29.9 million tonnes (15.9 million tonnes FY2017).
Total metallurgical coal sales were up 16%
on the year prior, achieving 7.2 million tonnes
(6.2 million tonnes FY2017).
Yancoal continued to implement cost reduction
strategies at each of its mines, restructuring the
Mount Thorley Warkworth operation to introduce
significant fleet efficiencies to improve maintenance
times and overall haul rates.
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Record production at a time of sustained
pricing strength across global coal markets
drove Yancoal’s financial turnaround, achieving
a record profit after tax of A$852 million
(2017: A$229 million) from revenue of
A$4,850 million (2017: A$2,601 million)
for the year ended 31 December 2018.
Yancoal achieved a total operating EBITDA
of A$2,180 million, driven by a full year’s equity
contribution from Mount Thorley Warkworth
(A$718 million) and Hunter Valley Operations
(A$513 million), acquired on 1 September 2017.
EBITDA contributions included the additional
benefit of a full year’s underground production
achieved at the Moolarben Coal Complex
(total Moolarben complex equity contribution
of A$871 million), with the underground mine
having commenced longwall mining in October
2017 on budget and ahead of schedule.
The Group realised an average price1 of A$123
for its thermal coal products (2017: A$102)
and A$182 for its metallurgical coal products
(2017: A$165), representing an overall average
price of A$132 (2017: A$114).
Thermal coal sales represented 81% (2017: 72%)
of total coal sales, based on sales tonnes including
external purchase coal sales.
FOB Cash Costs per tonne excluding royalties
were A$63 (2017: A$62) per tonne, a slight increase
on the year prior due to rises in coal mining sector
inflationary costs and the addition of a full year’s
attributable ownership of the Mount Thorley
Warkworth and Hunter Valley Operations
acquired in September 2017.
1 Excluding resale of purchased coal.
