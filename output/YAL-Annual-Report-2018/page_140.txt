NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018

D7 RESERVES
Accounting Policies
When a financial instrument is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the
hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging reserve until the anticipated underlying
transaction occurs. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, or is sold, terminated or expires, any accumulated gain or loss
remains in equity until the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to
occur, then the amount accumulated in equity is immediately recognised in profit or loss.
Shares held by the Group sponsored Employee Share Plan Trust are recognised as treasury shares and deducted from equity.
The fair value of equity plans granted is recognised in the employee compensation reserve over the vesting period. This reserve will be
reversed against treasury shares when the underlying shares vest and transfer to the employee at the fair value. The difference between the
fair value at grant date and the amount received against treasury shares is recognised in retained earnings (net of tax).

The hedging reserve is used to record gains or losses on cash flow hedges that are recognised directly in equity through the Consolidated
Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income.
The closing balance relates to the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of the natural cash flow hedge using the
US dollar denominated interest-bearing liabilities to hedge against future coal sales.
During the year ended 31 December 2018, losses of $160 million were transferred from other comprehensive income to profit or loss in respect
of the hedging reserve (31 December 2017 a loss of $229 million).
