Operating risks
The Company’s operations are subject to operating risks that
could result in decreased coal production which could reduce their
respective revenues. Operational difficulties may impact the amount
of coal produced, delay coal deliveries or increase the cost of mining
for a varying length of time. These operating risks include (but are not
limited to) industrial action, mine collapses, cave-ins or other failures
relating to mine infrastructure, including tailings dams, interruptions
due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions, power interruption,
critical equipment failure (in particular any protracted breakdown
or issues with any of the Company’s CHPPs or a major excavator),
fires, and explosions from methane gas or coal dust, accidental mine
water discharges, flooding and variations in or unusual or unexpected
geological or geotechnical mining conditions (particularly in the
Company’s underground operations). Such risks could result in
damage to applicable mines, personal injury, environmental damage,
delays in coal production, decreased coal production, loss of revenue,
monetary losses and possible legal liability. Although the Company’s
insurance policies provide coverage for some of these risks, the
amount and scope of insurance cover is limited by market and
economic factors and there can be no assurance that these risks
would be fully covered by insurances maintained by the Company.
Injury or accident risks
If any injuries or accidents occur in a mine, this could have adverse
financial implications including legal claims for personal injury, wrongful
death, amendments to approvals, potential production delays or
stoppages, any of which may have a material adverse effect on the
financial performance and/or financial position of the Company.
Funding risks
The amount of future funding required by the Company will depend
on a number of factors, including the performance of the Company’s
business at that time. The Company’s business operations and
cash flow are highly sensitive to any fluctuation in the US$ coal price,
coal production from its operations, demand for its coal product and
US$ movement in foreign exchange rates, particularly movements in
the A$:US$ exchange rate.
In developing its business plan and operating budget, the Company
has made certain assumptions regarding coal prices, the A$:US$
exchange rate, future production levels and other factors which
determine the Company’s financial performance.
If a funding shortfall materialises, the Company may need to raise
substantial additional debt or equity. The Company’s capacity to
secure the requisite level of funding will depend on the amount
of funding required, the performance and future prospects of its
business and a number of other factors, including US$ coal prices,
interest rates, economic conditions, debt market conditions, equity
market conditions and future levels of Yanzhou support.
To the extent that the Company is not able to secure additional
financing (whether debt or equity) on acceptable terms from third
parties, the Company will continue to rely on financial support
from Yanzhou.
As at 31 December 2018, the Company had a loan receivable from
Watagan of A$813 million (re-drawable up to A$1.36 billion) which
is subject to impairment testing. There is a guarantee provided
by Yankuang (being the ultimate parent entity of the Company) to
indemnify the Company for any amounts due and payable under the
loan which are not paid by Watagan.
