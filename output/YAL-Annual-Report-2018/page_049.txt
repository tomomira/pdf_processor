Gain on disposal of interest in joint venture of $78 million is a one-off gain recognised on the disposal of a 16.6% interest in the HVO joint venture
to Glencore whereby it was determined that the fair value of the consideration received and receivable exceeded the book value of the assets
and liabilities being de-recognised.
Fair value losses recycled from the hedge reserve of $160 million (2017: $229 million) represent retranslation losses on the Group’s US dollar-
denominated loans which are attributable to changes in US$:A$ foreign exchange rates. Under the Group’s natural hedge policy, such losses are
recycled to the Statement of profit and loss based on the scheduled loan maturity dates. The amount of any fair value loss or gain recycled from
the hedge reserve in a period is a function of the amount of the hedged US dollar loan scheduled to mature in that period and the respective
US$:A$ exchange rates at the time the hedge was put in place and at the time the loan matured.
Stamp duty of $25 million was recognised on the acquisitions of the further 28.9% interest in the Warkworth joint venture, and the further 4%
interest in the Moolarben joint venture together with the final-true up on the C&A Acquisition. In 2017 stamp duty of $167 million was recognised
on the C&A Acquisition.
Transaction costs of $29 million were recognised on the Hong Kong Initial Public Offering (IPO) (excluding capitalised equity raise costs).
In 2017 transaction costs of $33 million were recognised on the C&A Acquisition and associated equity raise (excluding capitalised equity
raise costs).
Re-measurement of contingent royalty of $33 million (2017: nil) represents an increase in the provision recognised on the C&A Acquisition with
respect to the contingent coal price-linked royalty potentially payable to Rio Tinto from 1 September 2020.
Re-measurement of financial assets of $29 million (2017: nil) and impairment of financial assets of $21 million (2017: nil) both related to the
decrease in the carrying value of the Group’s investments in the WICET issued E Class Wiggins Island Preference Securities and WICET
issued Gladstone Long Term Securities from $64 million to $14 million recognised during the year as a result of the lead bank syndicate’s loan
restructure negatively impacting their assessed fair value/recoverable amount.
Re-measurement of the royalty receivable of $4 million (2017: $8 million) relates to the change in the estimated fair value of the Group’s
Middlemount royalty receivable recognised on its right to receive a royalty of 4% of Free on Board Trimmed Sales on 100% of the Middlemount
mine coal sales.
In 2017 non-operating items also included a $177 million gain on acquisition on the C&A Acquisition, a $100 million impairment reversal on the
mining tenements at Moolarben and a $5 million one-off joint venture participant receipt.
