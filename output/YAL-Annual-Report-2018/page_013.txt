CAPITAL ALLOCATION
The cash from operations surged to $1.75 billion
in 2018, a four-fold increase over 2017. The
increased production base, strong commodity
pricing and stable operating costs all contributed
to this compelling outcome. The robust cash flow
enables Yancoal to pursue several initiatives
concurrently.
The first stage in the capital allocation cycle
is to concurrently meet the primary obligations.
REINVESTMENT
– PRIMARY OBLIGATION #1
Future operating cash flow depends upon the
assets delivering the availability and utilisation
targets. Reinvesting in the operations and
equipment is essential to this. The forecast capital
and sustaining expenditure in 2019 is $285 million;
this is less than the prior three-year average as the
equipment upgrade cycle and expansion project
required higher levels of capital in previous years
but has reduced the near-term burden.
DIVIDEND RETURNS
– PRIMARY OBLIGATION #2
The Board provides shareholders with direct
exposure to the Company’s performance via an
Net Profit After Tax (NPAT) based distribution.
In 2018 the total Dividend allocation was $507
million; including the special dividend this was
a payout ratio of ~60% from Net Profit After Tax.
The 2019 target is a 50% NPAT payout ratio1.
The next stage of the capital cycle is consideration
of the discretionary opportunities. The Board
seeks to balance the relative merits of each
against the other.
DEBT REDUCTION
– DISCRETIONARY PURSUIT #1
The rapid reduction of debt is something the
Company continues to deliver. US$1.4 billion
in debt has been repaid ahead of schedule since
the Coal & Allied transaction in late 2017. The debt
repayment brought the gearing ratio down to 35%
at the end of December2, and the Leverage Ratio
down to 1.4x3. Yancoal intends to continue making
early repayments to reduce its debt position and
optimise existing loan facilities; particularly in the
coming year given the coal price outlook.
GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES
– DISCRETIONARY PURSUIT #2
Yancoal has identified 12 million tonnes of
additional annual production to pursue within its
existing asset base. The internal expansion provides
a pathway for boosting operating cash flow.
The Coal & Allied transaction demonstrated that
external growth could also be tremendously
successful – it transformed the Company in 2018.
Examining opportunities for corporate acquisitions
is an ongoing effort, but growth must be accretive.
In the Capital Allocation Cycle, Asset Reinvestment
and Growth Opportunities support the future
cycles, Dividends reward the investors, and Debt
Reduction improves the capacity for all other steps.
1 The NPAT used will be adjusted for foreign exchange, hedge reserve
movements and non-operating items as determined by the Directors.
2 Gearing calculated as Net Debt divided by the sum of Net Debt and Equity.
3 Leverage Ratio calculated as Net Debt divided by Operating EBITDA.
Net Debt does not include the debt associated with Watagan.
