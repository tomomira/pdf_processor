MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
40      YANCOAL AUSTRALIA LTD
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
Yancoal operates a diversified portfolio of world class assets
consisting of both large-scale open cut and underground mines
comprising five coal mine complexes in Australia.
As a leading low-cost coal producer in the global seaborne market,
Yancoal’s coal mining operations produce a mix of premium thermal,
semi-soft coking, and pulverised coal injection (PCI) coals, together
with mid-to high-ash thermal coals.
The Group’s financial results are largely dependent on the demand
for thermal and metallurgical coal, which in turn depends on
macroeconomic trends, including regional and global economic activity,
and the price and availability of alternative forms of energy production.
Our customers are located throughout the Asia-Pacific region with
Japan, Singapore, China, South Korea and Taiwan accounting for
approximately 81% of our revenue from coal sales in the year ended
31 December 2018.
Thermal coal is primarily used in electricity generation and its end
users are typically power and utilities companies. Metallurgical coal is
primarily used to produce coke for blast furnace steel production and
its end users are typically steel plants. We also sell coal to customers
in the commodities trading business, who purchase the Group’s coal
for trading purposes or to on-sell to their end customers. Commodity
traders are similarly exposed to regional and global demand trends in
the coal market.
The Group’s export thermal coal is generally priced on either an index
price, an annual fixed price or on a spot price basis. Generally, lower
ash products are priced relative to the GlobalCOAL Newcastle index
and higher ash products are priced relative to the Argus/McCloskey
API5 index. Annual fixed price contracts are mostly priced against the
Japanese Power Utility (JPU) reference price, which is the contract price
agreed between major Australian suppliers and Japanese power utilities.
The balance of our sales are priced on a fixed spot price negotiated at
the time of settlement that also reflects the terms of the arrangement.
The Group’s export metallurgical coal is either priced on a benchmark
or spot price basis. Most term contracts are priced against a
benchmark pricing mechanism which is negotiated on a quarterly
basis between major Australian suppliers and Japanese steel mills.
Spot sales are priced relative to the market at the time and are
mostly done on a fixed price basis. The large majority of the Group’s
semi-soft coking coal out of Newcastle and low volatile PCI out of
Queensland is priced relative to the quarterly benchmark.
The Group’s coal sales revenue is typically recognised on a Free on
Board (FOB) basis when coal is loaded at the load port in Australia.
The Group’s overall average selling price of coal increased by 16%
from A$114 per tonne in 2017 to A$132 per tonne in 2018, mainly as
a result of the increase in global coal market prices during this period,
including low-ash thermal coal prices increasing by approximately
US$19 per tonne and semi-soft metallurgical coal prices increasing
by approximately US$15 per tonne. The Group’s average selling price
of thermal coal increased from A$102 per tonne to A$123 per tonne,
while the average selling price of metallurgical coal increased from
A$165 per tonne to A$182 per tonne.
The Group’s overall average cash operating costs excluding
government royalties increased from A$62 per tonne in 2017 to
A$63 per tonne in 2018 primarily due to an increase in raw materials
and consumables used due to an increase in diesel costs of 123%,
primarily due to increased market prices for diesel fuel and larger
truck fleets at the acquired Coal & Allied Industries Limited (C&A)
mines. The Group’s overall cash operating costs including government
royalties increased from A$71 per tonne in 2017 to A$73 per tonne
in 2018 with the increase in royalties driven by higher coal prices.
