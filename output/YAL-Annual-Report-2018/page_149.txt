The accounting for the acquisition has been determined on a provisional basis at 31 December 2018. Any adjustments to the provisional values
as a result of completion work on the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired will be recognised within 12 months of the acquisition date and
will be recognised as if they had occurred as at the date of acquisition.
(iii) Revenue and profit contribution
The acquired interest contributed revenue of $6 million and net profit of $1 million to the Group for the period from 1 December 2018 to
31 December 2018. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2018, consolidated revenue and net profit before tax for the period ended
31 December 2018 would have been $78 million and $40 million respectively. These amounts have been calculated using the Group’s
accounting policies.
(b) Disposal of 16.6% interest in Hunter Valley Operation to Glencore
(i) Summary of disposal
On 4 May 2018, the Company announced that it had completed the establishment of a 51%:49% unincorporated joint venture with Glencore
Coal Pty Ltd (“Glencore”) in relation to Hunter Valley Operations (“HVO JV”) as was previously announced on 27 July 2017 and held a 51%:49%
shareholding in HVO Services Pty Ltd, HV Operations Pty Ltd and HVO Coal Sales Pty Ltd (together the “HVO entities”).
Glencore paid cash consideration of US$1,139 million for 49% of HVO JV and the HVO entities, of which US$710 million was paid to Mitsubishi
Development Pty Ltd (“MDP”) for its 32.4% interest and US$429 million was paid to a wholly owned subsidiary of Yancoal, Coal & Allied
Operations Pty Ltd, for its 16.6% interest, adjusted for a net debt and working capital adjustment and an adjustment for the net cash inflows
of HVO since 1 September 2017.
Yancoal will also receive from Glencore a 27.9% share of the US$240 million non-contingent royalties payable by Yancoal to Rio Tinto Plc
(“Rio Tinto”) resulting from the acquisition of Coal & Allied Industries Ltd, which occurred on 1 September 2017. The US$429 million includes
US$20 million associated with the transfer of shares in Newcastle Coal Shippers held by Coal & Allied Industries Limited and Warkworth Coal
Sales Limited to a Glencore subsidiary.
Glencore acquired MDP’s 32.4% HVO interest directly from MDP in place of Yancoal’s tag-along offer. From 4 May 2018 Yancoal continued
to proportionately consolidate its 51% interest in the HVO JV, deconsolidated the HVO entities and continued to account for these entities as
joint ventures. Details of the sale proceeds, the net identifiable assets disposed of and the gain on disposal of the interest in joint venture and
subsidiaries are as follows:
