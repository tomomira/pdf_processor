(4)	 On 17 February 2016, Yancoal announced a new financing arrangement to secure up to US$950 million in debt funding via the issuing of nine-year secured debt bonds
by a newly established Yancoal subsidiary, Watagan Mining Company Pty Ltd (“Watagan”), to Industrial Bank Co. Ltd, BOCI Financial Products Limited and United NSW
Energy Limited. Under the arrangement, Yancoal’s interests in the assets of Ashton, Austar and Donaldson were transferred to and held by Watagan.
(5)	 Coal Reserves have been depleted from the previous reporting period due to ongoing studies and investigations in the Stage 3 area during 2018. Austar was subject to
prohibition notices issued by the Resource Regulator that restricted current operations in Bellbird South and investigations by the Resource Regulator are continuing.
Ongoing work is being undertaken by Watagan in respect of the very challenging geological and geotechnical conditions at the Austar mine, including both the Bellbird
South and Stage 3 areas that may have a significant adverse impact on future commercial operations. The future prospects of the Austar mine are therefore uncertain, and
will depend upon the work currently being conducted by Watagan and its internal and external advisers. If it is determined that the mine is unable to return to previously
forecast levels of production, there may be a need to proceed to a permanent shutdown. For further details Refer to “Prospectus for Hong Kong IPO – Part 1 of 5”
published on 26 October 2018 or “YAL Full Year Statutory Account and Appendix 4E” published on 25 February 2019.

Note: +ve = increase in reported Coal Reserves, –ve = decrease in reported Coal Reserves.
(6)	 The reported Coal Reserves totals within the JORC Reserve Reports utilised for public reporting are rounded (significant figure), whereas the Coal Reserve reconciliations
contained within them are based on the unrounded numbers; this adjustment is required to align the unrounded reconciliations with the significant figure rounded Coal
Reserve totals.
