YANCOAL 82.9%
A tier-one resource producing semi-soft coking
coal and thermal coal, Mount Thorley Warkworth
is an integrated operation of two open cut mines
located adjacent to each other, 15 kilometres
south‑west of Singleton in the Hunter Valley region
of New South Wales.
YARRABEE
QLD
YANCOAL 100%
Producing ultra-low volatile, semi-anthracite
PCI coal, the Yarrabee open cut mine exports
to steelmakers in the Asian region via the
Port of Gladstone.
Mount Thorley Warkworth uses a dragline and truck and
shovel methods, processing its coal through two on-site
coal preparation plants to produce low, medium and high ash
thermal coal and semi-soft coking coal for the export market.
Yancoal manages Mount Thorley Warkworth on behalf
of the joint venture partners:
•	 Mount Thorley: Yancoal Australia Ltd (80%) and
POSCO Australia Pty Ltd (20%).
•	 Warkworth: CNA Warkworth Australasia Pty Limited
(55.722%), CNA Resources Limited (28.75%), Nippon Steel
Australia Pty Limited (9.53%) and Mitsubishi Materials
(Australia) Pty Limited (6%).
Yarrabee uses conventional truck and excavator methods,
with ROM coal processed at the site's coal handling preparation
plant or bypassed for crushing only. Approximately 40% of the
ROM coal is bypassed due to its superior in-situ quality.
The Yarrabee open cut coal mine is located approximately
40 kilometres north-east of Blackwater in Central Queensland’s
Bowen Basin, with product coal exported via the RG Tanna and
Wiggins Island Coal Terminals.
Yarrabee achieved total ROM coal production of 3.4Mt
and total saleable coal production of 2.6Mt.
Coal is loaded onto trains for transportation 90 kilometres
to the Port Waratah Coal Terminal in Newcastle and shipped
to international customers.
Mount Thorley Warkworth achieved ROM coal production of 17.6Mt
and saleable coal production of 12.1Mt in 2018.
