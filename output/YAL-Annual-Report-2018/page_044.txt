(1)	 Includes the reclassification of interest income of $119 million (2017: $114 million) from Other income to Net finance costs and Bank fees and other charges of $96 million
(2017: $109 million) from Other operating expenses to Net finance costs as these amounts are excluded from Operating EBITDA.
To supplement the Group’s consolidated financial statements, which are presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs), the Group also uses adjusted Operating EBITDA and Operating EBIT as additional financial measures, as set out in the table
above, which are unaudited and not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRSs. These financial measures are presented because they
are used by management to evaluate the Group’s financial performance. These non-IFRS measures provide additional information to investors
and others in understanding and evaluating the consolidated results of operations in the same manner as they help management compare the
financial results across accounting periods with those of Yancoal’s peer companies, by removing one-off or non-operating items.
As presented by the management, Operating EBITDA represents profit before income tax for the year as adjusted for net finance costs,
depreciation and amortisation and any significant non-operating items; while Operating EBIT represents profit before income tax as adjusted
for net finance costs and any significant non-operating items.
