Note: 2018 Coal Reserves have been rounded in line with the JORC Code and the Yancoal reporting standards to reflect the relative uncertainty of the estimates.
Note: All Coal Resources are inclusive of Coal Reserves; Coal Reserves are reported on a 100% basis with Yancoal’s ownership percent reported for each deposit.
The attributable share total is the total Coal Reserves when the Yancoal ownership percent (as at 31 December 2018) is applied.
Note: Coal Reserves detailed in table are as at 31 December 2018, with the exception of (1)HVO (OC) which is as at 30 June 2018.
(1)	 Hunter Valley Operations (HVO).
(2)	 Gloucester comprises the Stratford, Duralie and Grant & Chainey deposits.
(3)	 The project has two product types for Marketable Coal Reserves each with a different Moisture basis, Coking at 10.5%, PCI at 9% and Ash% of 10% for Coking and
11% for PCI. Middlemount, which is situated within ML703379, has been expanded by 472 hectares after a deal with Anglo American Australia in 2017.

Note: +ve = increase in reported Coal Reserves, –ve = decrease in reported Coal Reserves.
(6)	 The reported Coal Reserves totals within the JORC Reserve Reports utilised for public reporting are rounded (significant figure), whereas the Coal Reserve reconciliations
contained within them are based on the unrounded numbers; this adjustment is required to align the unrounded reconciliations with the significant figure rounded Coal
Reserve totals.
