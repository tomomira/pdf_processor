AUD/USD forecast exchange rate.

(i)	 This represents the change in recoverable amount due to a +/– 10% change to our coal price assumption.
(ii)	 This represents the change in recoverable amount due to a +/– 5 cents change to the long-term US$:A$ foreign exchange rate adopted.
(iii)	 This represents the change in recoverable amount due to a +/– 50bps change in discount rate adopted.
If coal prices were –10% LOM the recoverable amount would exceed book value for all CGUs with the exception of Yarrabee which exceeded
the recoverable amount by $90 million. If the AUD/USD long-term forecast exchange rate was $0.80 the recoverable amount would exceed
book value for all CGUs with the exception of Yarrabee which exceeded the recoverable amount by $6 million.
Goodwill
The Yarrabee goodwill was not subject to an impairment charge as the recoverable amount is greater than the carrying value for this CGU.
C4 EXPLORATION AND EVALUATION ASSETS
Accounting Policy
Exploration and evaluation expenditure incurred is accumulated in respect of each separately identifiable area of interest which is at the
individual exploration permit or licence level. These costs are only carried forward where the right of tenure for the area of interest is current
and to the extent that they are expected to be recouped through successful development and commercial exploitation, or alternatively,
sale of the area, or where activities in the area have not yet reached a stage which permits reasonable assessment of the existence of
economically recoverable reserves and active and significant operations in, or in relation to, the area of interest are continuing.
Exploration and evaluation assets acquired in a business combination are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date. The carrying
amount of exploration and evaluation assets is assessed for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest the carrying amount of the
assets may exceed their recoverable amount. A regular review is undertaken for each area of interest to determine the appropriateness of
continuing to carry forward costs in relation to each area of interest. Accumulated costs in relation to an abandoned area are written off in
full in the period in which the decision to abandon the area is made.
Once the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the extraction of mineral resources in an area of interest are demonstrable,
the exploration and evaluation assets attributable to that area of interest are first tested for impairment and then reclassified to
mining tenements.
