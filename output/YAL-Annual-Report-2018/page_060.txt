While we do not currently calculate our Scope 3 emissions associated
with the consumption of our coal products, we actively support
the development of technologies aimed at reducing the emissions
intensity of these downstream activities. This includes supporting
the development and installation of high efficiency, low emissions
technologies in coal fired power stations and investment in carbon
capture and storage technology.
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE STATE OF AFFAIRS
There have been no significant changes to the state of affairs during
the financial year that significantly affected the operations of the
Group, the results of those operations or the state of affairs of Yancoal
or the Group.
MATTERS SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR
On 4 January 2019 BOCI notified Watagan and Yankuang that it
was exercising its put option over US$200 million of bonds. As a
consequence, Yankuang will become the bondholder of the put bonds
following completion of the purchase of those bonds by Yankuang
expected to occur on or around 1 April 2019. No security will be given
by Watagan in favour of Yankuang. As the put bonds represent less
than 50.1% of the face value of the bonds, and the put option was
not exercised by the instructing bondholder, the put option is not
deemed to have been exercised as to all the bonds nor has control
of Watagan been regained by the Group such that Watagan continues
to be deconsolidated.
On 25 February 2019, Yancoal announced a final dividend of
A$377 million (A$0.2855 per share to be comprised of an ordinary
dividend of A$0.1596 and a special dividend of $0.1259), with a
record date of 11 March 2019. The final dividend and special dividend
will be paid on 30 April 2019.
As announced 25 February 2019, Yancoal will pre-pay a
further US$500 million in loans, reducing its total debt liabilities
by US$1.4 billion since September 2017. The pre-payment
consists of US$250 million in pre-paid loans from Bank of China
and China Construction Bank, and US$250 million in pre-paid
Yanzhou‑related loans.
On 4 March 2019, Yancoal issued 1,744,704 performance share
rights (STIP rights) and 1,483,811 performance share rights
(LTIP rights) to the Executive Director, and certain senior Executives
of the Company.
On 29 March 2019, the Company agreed to enter into four coal sales
agreements with POSCO Australia Pty Ltd and/or its associates
pursuant to which POSCO and/or its associates have agreed to
purchase coal from the Group during the financial year ending 31
December 2019. As POSCO is interested in 20% of the Mount
Thorley JV, a subsidiary of the Company under the Listing Rules,
POSCO is a connected person of the Company by virtue of being
a substantial shareholder of the Company’s subsidiary. The maximum
annual transaction amount to be received by the Group from POSCO
and/or its associates for the sale of coal pursuant to the 2019 POSCO
Sales Agreements for the year ending 31 December 2019 will not
exceed US$780 million.
Other than as disclosed above, no matters or circumstances have
occurred subsequent to the end of the financial period which have
significantly affected, or may significantly affect, the operations of the
Group, the results of those operations or the state of affairs of the
Group in the subsequent financial period.
LIKELY DEVELOPMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Yancoal continues to pursue its long-term strategy for organic growth
via the progression of brownfield expansion and extension projects.
Key projects include the conceptual underground mine at Mount
Thorley Warkworth with an estimated 6Mtpa ROM, with exploration
drilling for the prefeasibility on the target seams having been
completed at the end of 2018.
Yancoal received approvals to commence mining activities associated
with the Lot 1 and Lot 2 areas of Mount Thorley Warkworth during the
reporting period, enabling commencement of the expansion of the
existing West pit on the Warkworth side in 2019.
Proposed modifications for the Moolarben open cut pits are awaiting
approval, as Yancoal continues to maximise improved extraction rates
in both the open cut and underground mines.
Yancoal will maintain strong cost discipline, with 2019 cash costs
(excluding government royalties) expected to remain flat at around
A$62.5/t (2018: A$63/t). Guidance for saleable coal production in
2019 is approximately 35 million tonnes (attributable). Forecast for
2019 capital expenditure is around AU$285 million (attributable).
