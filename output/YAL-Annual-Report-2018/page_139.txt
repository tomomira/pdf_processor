date, 30 May 2018.

Special Incentive Scheme Breakeven Bonus and Transaction Bonus
On 30 May 2018, the Yancoal Board agreed to pay the Special Incentive Scheme Breakeven Bonus and Transaction Bonus in performance
rights instead of a cash payment. The Special Incentive Scheme Breakeven Bonus and Transaction Bonus performance rights vested on
1 September 2018, and would have expired 3 September 2018. The purpose of this scheme has been detailed in the 31 December 2017
Annual Report and it was granted to the Key Management Personnel and Executives. Under the Special Incentive Scheme Breakeven Bonus
and Transaction Bonus, there were a maximum of 1,216,428 shares available for issue, which, if they were issued as new shares, represents
0.01% of share capital on issue at 31 December 2018. The performance rights were settled through issuance of treasury shares purchased
off market during 2018 by the Employee Share Plan Trust; refer to Note D6(b) for further details.
The fair value of these performance rights has been determined using the following assumptions:
