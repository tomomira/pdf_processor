C7 TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES
Accounting Policy
Trade and other receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the reporting period which are classified
as non-current assets. After initial recognition, trade and other receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method
apart from Wiggins Island Preference Shares (“WIPS”) which are classified as fair value through profit and loss. Refer to Note F5(b) for
detailed policies in relation to recognition, measurement, impairment and derecognition of trade and other receivables.

(i)	 As part of the equity raising completed in 1 September 2017 US$28 million was deposited in Yankuang Ozstar (Ningbo) Trading Co Limited,
a related party, and a promissory note was issued to the Company. Management believes that this will be settled within the next 12 months.
(ii)	 Receivables from joint venture includes a loan provided to Middlemount Coal Pty Ltd (“Middlemount”) with a face value of $233 million. From
1 January 2019 the shareholders of Middlemount agreed to make the loan interest free for 24 months. At 31 December 2018 this loan has
been revalued using the effective interest rate method to $218 million with the difference being recognised as a contribution to the joint venture.
(iii)	 Receivables from other entities includes the Group’s investment in securities issued by Wiggins Island Coal Export Terminal Pty Ltd (“WICET”).
These include E Class WIPS of nil (2017: $29 million) and Gladstone Island Long Term Securities (“GiLTS”) of $14 million (2017: $32 million).
At 31 December 2018 the WIPS were revalued to nil, the GiLTS were impaired by $17 million to a carrying value of $14 million, and a trade
and other receivable unpaid deferred distribution from WICET of $4 million was fully impaired.
The Group does not have a standardised and universal credit period granted to its customers, and the credit period of individual customers is
considered on a case-by-case basis, as appropriate. The following is an aged analysis of trade receivables based on the invoice dates at the

The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances. Management closely monitors the credit quality of trade receivables and considers
the balances that are neither past due or impaired to be of good quality.
