DIRECTORS’ REPORT (CONTINUED)

7.	 Share Trading Policy and Insider Trading Policy
The Company’s Share Trading Policy prohibits dealing in Company securities or Yanzhou securities by KMP and other relevant employees,
as well as their closely related persons, during specified blackout periods each year and when they are in possession of “inside information”.
Directors, KMP and their closely related persons are also prohibited from dealing in securities of a listed company where he or she is in
possession of inside information in relation to those securities. Subject to compliance with the Company’s Share Trading Policy and Insider
Trading Policy, employees are permitted to deal in Company securities or Yanzhou securities outside these blackout periods where they are
not in possession of inside information; however additional approval requirements apply to Directors.
The Share Trading Policy precludes relevant employees from entering into any hedge or derivative transactions relating to unvested options
or share rights granted to them under incentive plans and securities that are subject to holding locks or restrictions from dealing under such
plans. There are also restrictions regarding margin lending arrangements, hedging and short-term trading of the Company’s securities. Each
Director and KMP is required to provide a declaration at the end of each financial year certifying that they (and their closely related persons)
have complied with the Share Trading Policy and the Insider Trading Policy for the duration of that financial year.
