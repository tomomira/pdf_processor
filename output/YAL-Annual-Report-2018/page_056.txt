REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
Safety
Yancoal employs approximately 4,000 people in addition to the
contractors and service providers who support the Group’s operations.
Yancoal Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (“TRIFR”) for
the reporting period was 7.74, an improvement on 10.43 in the
previous year.
No significant events were recorded at Yancoal’s mine sites for
the period, with sites continuing to operate to legislative and
safety standards.
Under the direction of the Health, Safety and Environment Committee,
Yancoal remains committed to operating safely and transparently to
achieve its objective of zero harm.
Yancoal continues to implement its Critical Controls safety training
initiative across all operations, identifying key hazards within the
workplace and instituting effective management and response
practices for all people on site to follow.
Financial performance
Yancoal achieved a total operating earnings before interest and tax
(“EBIT”) of $1,657 million before tax, up $925 million on the year prior.
Yancoal’s profit after income tax was $852 million (2017: $229 million)
from revenue of $4,850 million (2017: $2,601 million) for the full year
ended 31 December 2018.
1	 Syndicate of five domestic and international banks.
Yancoal’s improved financial performance continued to be driven
by sustained high production rates at its low-cost tier-one assets,
maximising sales opportunities to meet increasing global demand
as metallurgical coal and thermal coal prices continued to strengthen.
Yancoal operations continued to implement cost reduction and
efficiency initiatives throughout 2018, maximising blended products
across the New South Wales operations (both managed and
operated) to meet increasing global market opportunities.
Cash flow
The full year’s net operating cash inflow of AU$1,747 million was up
AU$1,339 million on the year prior, the growth directly attributable to
the addition of a full year’s production at Mount Thorley Warkworth,
Hunter Valley Operations and the Moolarben underground at a time
of sustained high market prices for thermal and metallurgical coals.
Cash outflows from investing activities was AU$55 million, with the
receipt of AU$524 million for the sell-down of 16.6% in the Hunter
Valley Operations joint venture to Glencore Coal, largely offsetting
Yancoal’s AU$353 million purchase of Mitsubishi Development Pty
Ltd’s (“MDP”) 28.898% interest in the Warkworth joint venture and
2018 operating capital expenditure of AU$194 million.
Cash outflows from financing activities included the net repayment of
AU$1,014 million in interest-bearing liabilities, up from AU$196 million
in 2017, using improved cash from operations plus some funds from
the AU$268 million raised as part of the Global Offering associated
with its listing on the HKEx.
Corporate activities
As announced, on 29 November 2018 the Company launched a
Global Offering in connection with its listing on the Main Board of The
Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (“HKEx”).
On 6 December 2018 the Company issued 59,441,900 new shares
under the Global offering and on 28 December 2018 563,881 new
shares were issued under the Retail Entitlement offer and on 3 January
2019 4,361,900 new shares were issued under partial exercise of the
Over Allotment Option, all in connection with the Global Offering for
HK$23.48 per New Share (approximately AU$4.09). The total amount
raised was AU$268 million and AU$37 million of issue costs were
incurred of which AU$8 million was capitalised.
Details of the Shares movements by Yancoal are set out in Note D4(b)
and D7(c) of the financial statements. Other than as disclosed above,
during the year ended 31 December 2018, neither Yancoal nor any
of its subsidiaries purchased, sold or redeemed any of Yancoal’s
listed securities.
Settlement of the Global Offering, and the issue and commencement
of trading of the shares on the HKEx, occurred 6 December 2018,
establishing Yancoal as Australia’s largest pure-play, dual-listed
coal producer.

net payments made on interest bearing liabilities of US$900 million
since 1 September 2017. In 2018, Yancoal repaid US$125 million of

Facility Agreement. As at 31 December 2018, Yancoal had pre-

proceeds used to repay the Syndicated Facility.
