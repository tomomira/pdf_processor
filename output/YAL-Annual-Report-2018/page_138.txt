Fair value of performance rights granted/expected to be granted in the year
2018 STIP and 2018 LTIP
During the year ended 31 December 2018, 3,093,010 performance rights were granted or expected to be granted to Key Management
Personnel and Executives as part of incentive plans for services performed during the year. Of the 3,093,010 performance rights, 1,609,198
relate to the 2018 STIP where 25% of the total 2018 STIP payable is deferred until two years after the start of the service period, 31 December
2019, and 25% is deferred until three years after the start of the service period, 31 December 2020. They will expire on 1 January 2020 and
1 January 2021 respectively if these deferral conditions are not met.
During the year ended 31 December 2018, 1,483,812 performance rights were granted for the 2018 LTIP and will vest on 31 December 2020
on satisfaction of certain vesting conditions. The 2018 LTIP performance rights will expire on 1 January 2021 if these vesting conditions are
not met.
The purpose of the 2018 STIP and 2018 LTIP has been detailed in the Remuneration Report, contained within the Directors’ Report and these
have been granted or are expected to be granted to all Key Management Personnel and Executives. Under the 2018 STIP and 2018 LTIP,
there are a maximum of 3,093,010 shares available for issue, which, if issued as new shares, would represent 0.2% of share capital in issue at
31 December 2018.
The fair value of the 2018 STIP and 2018 LTIP performance rights has been determined using the following assumptions:
