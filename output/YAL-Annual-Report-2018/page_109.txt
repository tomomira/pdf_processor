(ii) Operating EBITDA
The Executive Committee assesses the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of Operating EBITDA. This measure
excludes the effects of non-recurring expenditure from the operating segments such as restructuring costs, business combination related
expenses and significant impairments of cash-generating units. Furthermore, the measure excludes the effects of fair value re-measurements
and foreign exchange gains/(losses) on interest-bearing liabilities. Interest income and expense are not allocated to the NSW and QLD
segments, as this type of activity is driven by the corporate function, which manages the cash position of the Group.
A reconciliation of Operating EBITDA to profit before income tax from continuing operations is provided as follows:
