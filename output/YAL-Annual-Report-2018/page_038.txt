Note: +ve = increase in reported Coal Reserves, –ve = decrease in reported Coal Reserves.
(1)	 The reported Coal Reserves totals within the JORC Reserve Reports utilised for public reporting are rounded (significant figure), whereas the Coal Reserve reconciliations
contained within them are based on the unrounded numbers; this adjustment is required to align the unrounded reconciliations with the significant figure rounded Coal
Reserve totals.
(2)	 HVO reconciliation is in regard to “as at 31 December 2017 to as at 30 June 2018”, with production depletions applied to 30 June 2018.
(3)	 Mount Thorley (OC) and Warkworth (OC) production depletion (14Mt and 21Mt) reflects production since 1 January 2017.
