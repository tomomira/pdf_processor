PROFIT ATTRIBUTABLE TO EQUITY HOLDERS OF THE COMPANY
Profit after income tax increased by 272% from $229 million in 2017 to $852 million in 2018 and was fully attributable to the owners of Yancoal
with no non-controlling interests.
Profit attributable to the owners of Yancoal of $852 million was impacted by a number of non-operating items during 2018. These included a
gain of $78 million on the disposal of a 16.6% interest in the HVO joint venture, a $160 million fair value loss recycled from the hedge reserve,
a $25 million stamp duty expense, $29 million of transaction costs, a $33 million contingent royalty revaluation, a $29 million financial asset
revaluation, a $21 million financial asset impairment and a $4 million royalty revaluation. These are discussed in more detail separately below and
have been excluded from the operating commentary.
OVERVIEW OF OPERATING RESULTS
The below year-on-year comparison of the financial results for the years ended 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017 is materially
impacted by changes in the Group’s portfolio of assets, most significantly:
––
the acquisition of C&A from 1 September 2017 (C&A Acquisition);
––
the acquisition of a further 28.9% interest in the Warkworth joint venture effective from 1 March 2018; the disposal of a 16.6% interest in
the HVO joint venture from 4 May 2018; and the acquisition of a further 4% interest in the Moolarben joint venture from 1 December 2018
(Other Acquisitions and Disposals); and
––
the expansion of the Moolarben mine from 14.7Mt ROM in 2017 to 18.6Mt ROM in 2018 (on a 100% basis).
The analysis in this section includes ex-mine sales tonnes and ex-mine revenue comprising (i) 81% of the Moolarben unincorporated joint venture
up to and including 30 November 2018 and 85% thereafter; (ii) 67.6% of the unincorporated HVO joint venture up to and including 3 May 2018
and 51% thereafter; (iii) 64.1% of the unincorporated MTW joint venture up to and including 28 February 2018 and 82.5% thereafter (iv); and
100% of Yarrabee and Stratford Duralie.
The result of HVO includes the 16.6% interest subsequently sold to Glencore Coal Pty Ltd (Glencore) on 4 May 2018 as during the first
four months of 2018 the Group included the operating results of the 16.6% interest in its statement of profit and loss and balance sheet.
The economic interest of the said 16.6% interest was effectively transferred to Glencore on 1 September 2017; however this was compensated
through an agreed reduced settlement price mechanism.
The results of Middlemount and Watagan are excluded from the line by line commentary below because their results, as incorporated
equity‑accounted investments, are included in Share of profits of equity-accounted investees, net of tax in the Statement of profit and loss
are discussed separately below.
