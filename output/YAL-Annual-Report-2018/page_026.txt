The Moolarben Coal Complex is an open cut
and underground coal asset located approximately
40 kilometres north of Mudgee in the Western
Coalfields of New South Wales.
Hunter Valley Operations is a multi-pit open cut mine, using
a dragline truck and shovel method, operating 24 hours a day.
ROM coal is processed through two on-site coal preparation plants
to produce low, medium and high ash thermal coal and semi-soft
coking coal for the export market.
Product coal is shipped via the Port Waratah Coal Terminal and
Newcastle Coal Infrastructure Group in Newcastle.
Hunter Valley Operations is a 51:49 unincorporated joint venture
with Glencore Coal Pty Ltd (“Glencore”), jointly controlled through
a Joint Venture Management Committee (“JVMC”).
Hunter Valley Operations achieved ROM coal production
of 19.0Mt and saleable coal production of 13.3Mt for the
attributable reporting period.
Moolarben utilises conventional truck and excavator methods
in its open cut mining areas, and longwall operations
in its underground mining areas.
ROM coal from the open cut pits is processed through an on-site
coal preparation plant, while ROM coal from the underground
operation is bypassed, in each case producing thermal coals
for sale into the export market.
Product coal is exported via the Newcastle Coal Infrastructure Group
and Port Waratah Coal Services loading terminals at Newcastle.
Production of the two open cut mines and the underground mine
achieved total ROM coal production of 18.6Mt and saleable coal
production of 16.5Mt.
Moolarben Coal Operations Pty Ltd is the operator of the Moolarben
Coal Complex on behalf of the Joint Venture (JV). The JV partners
are Moolarben Coal Mines Pty Ltd (85%), a consortium of Korean
companies represented by Kores Australia Moolarben Coal Pty Ltd
(5%), and Sojitz Moolarben Resources Pty Ltd (10%).
