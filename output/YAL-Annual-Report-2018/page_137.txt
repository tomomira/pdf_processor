The Group’s primary objectives when managing capital are to ensure the continued ability to provide a consistent return for equity stakeholders
through a combination of capital growth and distributions and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. In order
to achieve these objectives, the Group seeks to maintain a debt to debt plus equity ratio (gearing ratio) that balances risks and returns at
an acceptable level and also to maintain a sufficient funding base to enable the Group to meet its working capital and strategic investment
needs. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital
to shareholders, issue new shares or other equity instruments, repay debt or draw down additional debt.
