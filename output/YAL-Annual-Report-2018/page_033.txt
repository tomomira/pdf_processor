Note: 2018 Coal Resources have been rounded in line with the JORC Code and the Yancoal reporting standards to reflect the relative uncertainty of the estimates.
Note: All Coal Resources are inclusive of Coal Reserves and are reported on a 100% basis with Yancoal’s ownership percentage reported for each deposit. The attributable
share total is the total Coal Resources when the Yancoal ownership percentage (as at 31 December 2018) is applied.

Yancoal’s interests in the assets of Ashton, Austar and Donaldson were transferred to and held by Watagan.
